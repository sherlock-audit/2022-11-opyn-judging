# By maliciously calling `setNonceTrue`,  the execution of `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction` would alway fail

## Summary
A malicious user can make an order with a fair price to be included in the call data of `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction`. When watching `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction` is submitted to execute, this user can front-run a trasaction of calling `setNonceTrue` with higher gas to fail the check of nonce and revert the execution of `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The related code are summerized as follow.
```solidity
    function setNonceTrue(uint256 _nonce) external {
        nonces[msg.sender][_nonce] = true;
        emit NonceTrue(msg.sender, _nonce);
    }

    function _useNonce(address _trader, uint256 _nonce) internal {
        require(!nonces[_trader][_nonce], "Nonce already used");
        nonces[_trader][_nonce] = true;
    }

    function _checkOrder(Order memory _order) internal {
        _useNonce(_order.trader, _order.nonce);
        ...
    }

    function depositAuction(DepositAuctionParams calldata _p) external onlyOwner {
        ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _p.orders.length; i++) {
            ...
            _checkOrder(_p.orders[i]);
            ...
        }
        ...
    }

    function withdrawAuction(WithdrawAuctionParams calldata _p) public onlyOwner {
        ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _p.orders.length && toPull > 0; i++) {
            _checkOrder(_p.orders[i]);
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
```

1. Eve makes orders with fair prices to be included in the call data of `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction`;
2. Eve runs a Ethereum node so knows that `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction` is submitted to execute;
3. Eve front-runs a transaction of calling `setNonceTrue` with higher gas to set the nonce of his order to true;
4. Function `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction` would fail in `_checkOrder`, and revert.

## Impact
The execution of `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction` would alway fail by maliciously calling `setNonceTrue`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1.  Change from
```solidity
    function setNonceTrue(uint256 _nonce) external {
        nonces[msg.sender][_nonce] = true;
        emit NonceTrue(msg.sender, _nonce);
    }
```
to
```solidity
    function setNonceTrue(address _trader, uint256 _nonce) external onlyOwner {
        nonces[_trader][_nonce] = true;
        emit NonceTrue(msg.sender, _nonce);
    }
```
2. Or to set up a blacklist when constructing the call data of `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction`.
