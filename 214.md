# Need alternative methods to hedge and reduce risk

## Summary

Currently the CrabNetting.sol relies on `depositAuction()` and `withdrawAuction()` to hedge the position. However, in severe market conditions against the strategy, the hedge might not work as expected, because the auction relies on enough market counter parties. If case of not enough market liquidity, users have to suffer loss. 


## Vulnerability Detail

The crab strategy rebalance require enough counter parties in the market. Currently the auction use discounted price than uniswap to create incentives for counter parities. But it is possible that the market is extreme so that traders are completely not likely to open new positions. Or the slippage might deviate too much exceeding the max allowable tolerance (common in extreme markets).


#### scenario 1: up market

Imagine ETH price to the moon, but the volatility is low (low funding rate).
In this case, crab strategy needs to long ETH, (buy Squeeth, burn crab token), call `withdrawAuction()`.

- For traders who long Squeeth 
They are making big profit from the up market, likely to have more incentive to hold rather than sell. Or the slippage could be big.

- For traders who short Squeeth 
In up market, short ETH^2 with low funding rate is losing money, so low incentives for them to mint new  Squeeth.

- Uniswap LP
In single side market, impermanent loss is big, especially for concentrated LP in V3. As a result, liquidity providers are prone to withdraw the LP.

In summary, when ETH price skyrockets, those who short Squeeth face the risk of liquidation. But the auction takes time, and in extreme markets, each kind of traders lack the incentive to be the counter party to sell Squeeth to the crab contract. 

And the users already send the crab tokens into the contract in `queueCrabForWithdrawal()`, when `isAuctionLive` is true, they can not withdraw. If the auction does not succeed, the loss will be bigger.

Some mitigation might be, the admin takes immediate action to directly add collateral to avoid liquidation. 


#### scenario 2: crash market

Imagine ETH crashes suddenly.

In this case, crab strategy needs to short Squeeth, (mint crab token, mint Squeeth), call `depositAuction()`.

- For traders who long Squeeth 
In down markets, they have incur big loss, not likely to buy new minted Squeeth. In addition, they have funding rate cost.

- For traders who short Squeeth 
They are having higher funding rate and profits from ETH down. They tend to close the position later when vol is low. So are not likely to buy the new minted Squeeth either.

- Uniswap LP
Same as above, one side market, the liquidity could be low.

In summary, in market crash, to hedge to 0 delta, crab strategy needs counter parties to buy minted Squeeth. But it is possible that not enough market makers are taking part in. 

One more thing, in such market, the amount needed to hedge the position might be big, if `StrategyCap` is close, the protocol could fail to open short positions to make delta neutral.

Some mitigation might be, the admin take immediate action to short ETH in other ways, not necessarily through mint new Squeeth, such as perp swap or options. Since in low liquidity market, it is too hard to rely on one way.


Such kind of scenario that liquidity is completely drained happened before more than 1 time. Such as 03/12/2020, 05/19/2021, the market makers just quit quoting on deribit, which means no way to open positions to hedge.


## Impact

When the market is undergoing big moves in either direction. Users could lose fund due to liquidation, in the situation when not enough market maker participate in `withdrawAuction()`; or users portfolio could lose too much, in the situation when not enough market maker in `depositAuction()`. When it is too hard to hedge the negative delta.



## Code Snippet

`depositAuction()` and `withdrawAuction()` are the only ways to hedge

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The goal to maintain neutral delta is the basic idea of the strategy, which means the severe market condition is intrinsically hard to deal with. Some more approaches to deal with such bad scenario might help.

- add alternative methods to hedge directly, probably with admin privilege.
- consider add extra protection for the contingency markets, maybe through options (buy the tail OTM call and put).
