# Orders can be marked as used by anyone

## Summary

Orders can be marked as used by anyone. This can be used to invalidate orders and prevent them from future use and also revert the functions `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `checkOrder` can be called by anyone and calls `_checkOrder` -> `_useNonce`. The latter sets the `nonces` variable to mark the order as used, so `_checkOrder` can not be called again for this order. A user would need to re-sign the order with another nonce to enable its usage again:

```js
function checkOrder(Order memory _order) external {
    return _checkOrder(_order);
}

function _useNonce(address _trader, uint256 _nonce) internal {
    require(!nonces[_trader][_nonce], "Nonce already used");
    nonces[_trader][_nonce] = true;
}
```

A malicious actor could grief the calls to `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction` by watching the mempool and frontrunning them with a call to `checkOrder` for any order that is used in the `DepositAuctionParams` or `WithdrawAuctionParams`. This will cause `depositAuction` or `withdrawAuction` to revert as an order can not be checked twice.

```js 
//depositAuction (and withdrawAuction) iterate through all orders and try to check them
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _p.orders.length; i++) {
    require(_p.orders[i].isBuying, "auction order not buying sqth");
    require(_p.orders[i].price >= _p.clearingPrice, "buy order price less than clearing");
    _checkOrder(_p.orders[i]);
```

## Impact

User orders can be invalidated by any third person and key functions that are only callable by the owner such as `depositAuction` or `withdrawAuction` can be reverted by frontrunning.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either remove the externally callable `checkOrder` function (as the only thing it does is setting the `nonces` variable to true for an address+nonce) or at least verify that the `msg.sender` is also the trader/signer of that order. Though a user can achieve the same by using the function `setNonceTrue` for his own address.
