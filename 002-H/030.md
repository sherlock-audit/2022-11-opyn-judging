# Front-running to DoS the auctions

## Summary

It is possible to front-run`depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction`, checking an order before running these functions and DoSing the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `checkOrder` can be executed by anyone just passing order details, an auction is made through `depositAuction` and  `withdrawAuction` giving orders as params. Some malicious actors can get this info from mempool and front-run this function through the `checkOrder` function passing any order, and reverting the auction execution.

## Impact

The owner won't be able to execute any auction

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are two ways to fix this issue:

1. Add the `onlyAdmin` modifier to the `checkOrder` function 
2. Change the `checkOrder` function to create an order using the `trader` param as `msg.sender`
