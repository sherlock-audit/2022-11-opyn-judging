# Anyone can cancel other users auction orders

## Summary

The `checkOrder()` function is external, without any access controls. The function will invalidate any `Order` based on input.

## Vulnerability Detail

The external function `checkOrder()` calls `_useNonce()` which sets the trader's nonce to true and hence invalidates this `Order` for the deposit or withdrawal auction functions.

```Solidity
    function _useNonce(address _trader, uint256 _nonce) internal {
        require(!nonces[_trader][_nonce], "Nonce already used");
        nonces[_trader][_nonce] = true;
    }
```

This enables an attacker to cancel out someone's Order before the auction function is triggered if he has the targeted signed `Order` or by front-running the auction transaction which would cause a DoS.

This can also be verified with a test. Modified `testDepositAuctionPartialFill()` as a PoC:

## Recommendation

There's a few ways how to resolve this. My suggested way is to move `_useNonce()` out of `_checkOrder()` and call it separately inside both Auction functions. The require statement to check for nonce would then need to be moved from `_useNonce()` inside `_checkOrder()`.

Another way is also to restrict the external `checkOrder()` function to only allow the `Order` signer as the sender of the transaction, however I'm not sure that is the intended implementation here.
