# An attacker can cause a temporary DoS on auctions

## Summary

As the auctions for buying/selling SQUEETH are public, anyone can cause at least a temporary DoS by revoking their ERC20 approvals.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both Auction functions require that the bidders approve WETH and SQUEETH for the auction to function. While they can approve at bidding time, they can later revoke their approvals at auction settlement time, which will revert the auction. This would however be a temporary DoS depending on the attacker determination and skills as the particular order can be dismissed and auction repeated.

## Impact

Temporary DoS on executing the auctions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Fixing this would likely require a design change in how bidding is done to require bidders to deposit their bids for the duration of the auction.
