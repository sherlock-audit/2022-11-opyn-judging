# CrabNetting.depositsQueued and CrabNetting.withdrawsQueued will revert when there are many unprocessed deposits and withdraws

## Summary
CrabNetting.depositsQueued and CrabNetting.withdrawsQueued will revert when there are many unprocessed deposits and withdraws.
## Vulnerability Detail
CrabNetting.depositsQueued and CrabNetting.withdrawsQueued functions go over all unprocessed deposits or withdraws to calculate amount.
In case when this amount is big then function will start reverting.

As this functions are not used in the contract i guess it will affect UI.
## Impact
Functions will not be working.

## Recommendation
Add one more param like `count` and stop looping after it.
