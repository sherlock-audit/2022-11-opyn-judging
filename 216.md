# Order of operations affects prices / amounts

## Summary
Order of operations affects prices / amounts. This is a problem due to precision and division truncate, mostly if it also affects money/tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
Solidity integer division might truncate. Rather than dividing before multiplying, performing multiplication before division can avoid loss of precision.

## Impact
Smaller prices and amounts than real ones will be used

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Reorder the operations for avoiding losses

For example:
`usdcAmount = (((withdraw.amount * 1e18) / _p.crabToWithdraw) * usdcReceived) / 1e18;`
would be
`usdcAmount = ((withdraw.amount * 1e18) * usdcReceived) / (1e18 * _p.crabToWithdraw);`
