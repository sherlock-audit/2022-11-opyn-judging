# `usdcAmount` Will be Incorrect in `withdrawAuction()` When Attempting to Transfer Proportionate Amount

## Summary
There exists an issue in the `CrabNetting.sol` contract function `withdrawAuction()` when attempting to transfer the proportionate amount of USDC to a withdrawer. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The calculations in the code are assuming that USDC is of 18 decimal places. 

## Impact
Since USDC is being calculated using 18 decimal places, a withdrawer can get a disproportionate amount back from the contract. Since a user is getting more than the expected amount, attackers can leverage the offset of this decimal error to steal tokens from the contract.

```solidity
           if (withdraw.amount <= remainingWithdraws) {
                // full usage
                remainingWithdraws -= withdraw.amount;
                crabBalance[withdraw.sender] -= withdraw.amount;

                // send proportional usdc
                usdcAmount = (((withdraw.amount * 1e18) / _p.crabToWithdraw) * usdcReceived) / 1e18;  <-----
                IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, usdcAmount);
                emit CrabWithdrawn(withdraw.sender, withdraw.amount, usdcAmount, j);
                delete withdraws[j];
                j++;
            } else {
                withdraws[j].amount -= remainingWithdraws;
                crabBalance[withdraw.sender] -= remainingWithdraws;

                // send proportional usdc
                usdcAmount = (((remainingWithdraws * 1e18) / _p.crabToWithdraw) * usdcReceived) / 1e18; <-----
                IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, usdcAmount);
                emit CrabWithdrawn(withdraw.sender, remainingWithdraws, usdcAmount, j);

                remainingWithdraws = 0;
            }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend calculating the correct USDC amount by using `1e6` instead of `1e18` so the user receives the correct amount of USDC back from the `withdrawAuction()` contract.
