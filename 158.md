# Blacklisted USDC address can break contract functionality

## Summary
If one of the Crab withdrawers is blacklisted by USDC contract it will be impossible for CrabNetting to handle withdrawals initiated after the blacklisted user.

## Vulnerability Detail
When executing `netAtPrice` and `withdrawAuction` the contract goes through the list of withdraws in chronological order and sends USDC to sender addresses. If one of the addresses is blacklisted, USDC transfer to that address will be causing a revert. 
```solidity
i = withdrawsIndex;
while (crabQuantity > 0) {
    Receipt memory withdraw = withdraws[i];
    if (withdraw.amount == 0) {
        i++;
        continue;
    }
    if (withdraw.amount <= crabQuantity) {
        crabQuantity = crabQuantity - withdraw.amount;
        crabBalance[withdraw.sender] -= withdraw.amount;
        amountToSend = (withdraw.amount * _price) / 1e18;
        IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, amountToSend);

        emit CrabWithdrawn(withdraw.sender, withdraw.amount, amountToSend, i);

        delete withdraws[i];
        i++;
    } else {
        withdraws[i].amount = withdraw.amount - crabQuantity;
        crabBalance[withdraw.sender] -= crabQuantity;
        amountToSend = (crabQuantity * _price) / 1e18;
        IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, amountToSend);

        emit CrabWithdrawn(withdraw.sender, withdraw.amount, amountToSend, i);

        crabQuantity = 0;
    }
}
withdrawsIndex = i;
```

## Impact
The contract will be unable to perform swaps until blacklisted account cancels Crab withdrawal. The contract will become useless, however depositors will be able to get their funds back.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an interface:
```solidity
interface IBlacklistable {
    function isBlacklisted(address _account) external view returns (bool);
}
```
Add a function `cancelBlacklistedWithdraws` that will go through queued withdraws and cancel those that come from blacklisted users (send crab back to user and delete the record). Call it before `netAsPrice` and `withdrawAuction`
