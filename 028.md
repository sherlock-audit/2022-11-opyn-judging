# MEV in ExactInputSingleParams

## Summary

Setting  `amountOutMinimum` in the swap to 0 leads to MEV attack.

## Vulnerability Detail

The swap is called with `amountOutMinimum: 0`, meaning there is no slippage protection. This could result in a significant loss of yield from this reward as MEV bots could “sandwich” this swap by manipulating the price before this transaction and immediately reversing their action after the transaction, profiting at the expense of our swap.

## Impact

The owner sets the value for `DepositAuctionParams` and `WithdrawAuctionParams` and is possible to input `minEth` to 0 and this leads to a loss of funds by MEV bots.

## Code Snippet

[CrabNetting.sol#L534](https://github.com/opynfinance/squeeth-monorepo/blob/main/packages/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L534)

```solidity
ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams memory params = ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams({
  tokenIn: usdc,
  tokenOut: weth,
  fee: _p.ethUSDFee,
  recipient: address(this),
  deadline: block.timestamp,
  amountIn: _p.depositsQueued,
  amountOutMinimum: _p.minEth, //@audit this param shouldn't be 0
  sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
});
swapRouter.exactInputSingle(params);
```

[CrabNetting.sol#L682](https://github.com/opynfinance/squeeth-monorepo/blob/main/packages/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L682)

```solidity
ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams memory params = ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams({
  tokenIn: address(weth),
  tokenOut: address(usdc),
  fee: _p.ethUSDFee,
  recipient: address(this),
  deadline: block.timestamp,
  amountIn: (IERC20(weth).balanceOf(address(this)) - initWethBalance),
  amountOutMinimum: _p.minUSDC, //@audit this param shouldn't be 0
  sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
});
uint256 usdcReceived = swapRouter.exactInputSingle(params);
```

## Recommendation

Add a require for `_p.minEth != 0`
