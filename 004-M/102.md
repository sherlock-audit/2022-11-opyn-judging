# ECDSA Signature Malleability

## Summary

OpenZeppelin library version 4.7.0 is a dependency of this project. This version has a known vulnerability and the CrabNetting contract uses [the vulnerable `recover` function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h) from this library.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ECDSA `recover` function in this OpenZeppelin library version is vulnerable to a signature malleability weakness due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format. Signature malleability can lead to signature reuse. The [OpenZeppelin vulnerability writeup](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h) explains in more detail.

## Impact

This issue may lead to signature reuse.
