# The while loop in `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction` can revert the execution

## Summary
Since there is no sanity check on calldata `_p` for function `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction`,  two cases would cause revertion in while loop (using `depositAuction` for example):
1.  A wrong larger `_p.depositsQueued` is set;
2.  `_p.depositsQueued` is set correctly accroding the snapshot of on-chain data on block num `n1`;  but since `depositAuction` does not enforce `isAuctionLive` check, an user can submit a call to `withdrawUSDC` and actually reduce the number of USDC deposited (that is, the real `_p.depositsQueued` is decreased) on block `n2`; Then, the owner calls `depositAuction` with `_p.depositsQueued` larger than actual on block `n3` (`n3>n2>n1`), and the while loop would visit out of the bound of `deposits` triggering reversion.

## Vulnerability Detail
The critical while loop code of `depositAuction` is summerized as follow (`withdrawAuction` is almost the same):
```solidity
function depositAuction(DepositAuctionParams calldata _p) external onlyOwner {
    ...
    uint256 remainingDeposits = _p.depositsQueued;
    ...
    while (remainingDeposits > 0) {
        uint256 queuedAmount = deposits[k].amount;
        ...
        if (queuedAmount <= remainingDeposits) {
            remainingDeposits = remainingDeposits - queuedAmount;
            ...
            delete deposits[k];
            k++;
        } else {
            ...
        }
    }
    ...
}
```
When `_p.depositsQueued` is set larger than the actual number of USDC deposited as the two cases summarized above, the while loop would visit `deposits` out of bound (besides, `delete deposits[k]` equals to `deposits[k]=0`), and revert the execution.

## Impact
The while loop would visit out of the bound of `deposits` (or `withdraws` in function `withdrawAuction`), and revert the execution.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Add sanity check on `_p.depositsQueued`;
2. Ensure the auction is live when submit a call to function `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction`, like rewritten as
```solidity
function depositAuction(DepositAuctionParams calldata _p) external onlyOwner {
    require(isAuctionLive, "auction is not live");
    ...
}

function withdrawAuction(WithdrawAuctionParams calldata _p) public onlyOwner {
    require(isAuctionLive, "auction is not live");
    ...
}
```
