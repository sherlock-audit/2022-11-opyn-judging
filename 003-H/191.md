# Gas griefing vulnerability in `netAtPrice`, `depositAuction`, and `withdrawAuction`

## Summary
Gas griefing vulnerability in `netAtPrice`, `depositAuction`, and `withdrawAuction`
## Vulnerability Detail
User deposits are stored in unbounded arrays:
- `deposits` for USDC deposits ([CrabNetting.sol#L268](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L268));
- `withdraws` for CRAB deposits ([CrabNetting.sol#L314](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L314)).

In `netAtPrice`, `depositAuction`, and `withdrawAuction` functions these arrays are iterated over to match USDC and CRAB amounts for swapping ([CrabNetting.sol#L360-L417](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L360-L417), [CrabNetting.sol#L577-L619](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L577-L619), [CrabNetting.sol#L691-L719](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L691-L719)), which allows a gas griefing attack:
- an attacker creates many small deposits, 1 wei each;
- contract owner is forced to pay higher transaction fees when executing `netAtPrice`, `depositAuction`, or `withdrawAuction`.

The attack is viable even with the minimal deposit amount checks ([CrabNetting.sol#L262](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L262), [CrabNetting.sol#L311](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L311)) for multiple reasons:
- an attacker loses nothing since they get USDC/CRAB tokens at a market price;
- `minUSDCAmount` and `minCrabAmount` will be set to low amounts to include depositors with smaller amounts.

The issue can also raise naturally, not as a result of an attack, when `CrabNetting` attracts many users who deposit multiple amounts, and there's a delay between execution of `netAtPrice`, `depositAuction`, and `withdrawAuction`.
## Impact
A contract owner can be forced into paying higher transaction fees when executing `netAtPrice`, `depositAuction`, or `withdrawAuction`.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider grouping all active deposits (`amount > 0`) by user addresses to exclude the cost of iterating  over multiple deposits from the same user.
