# unbounded withdraw and deposit arrays will cause DOS if they become too big

## Summary
There is no limit to how big withdraw and deposit arrays can become. `depositsQueued` and `withdrawsQueued` will revert if too many deposits are queued or too many withdraws are queued.

## Vulnerability Detail
Both `depositsQueued` and `withdrawQueued` run through the array of queued deposits and queued withdraws respectively. If there are too many deposits or withdraws being queued, the respective function will revert due to exceeding the block gas limmit.
```solidity
    function depositsQueued() external view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 j = depositsIndex;
        uint256 sum;
        while (j < deposits.length) {
            sum = sum + deposits[j].amount;
            j++;
        }
        return sum;
    }
```

```solidity
    function withdrawsQueued() external view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 j = withdrawsIndex;
        uint256 sum;
        while (j < withdraws.length) {
            sum = sum + withdraws[j].amount;
            j++;
        }
        return sum;
    }
```
## Impact

DOS for `depositsQueued` and `withdrawQueued`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a maximum number of withdraws and deposits that can be queued.
