# Possible DoS in deposit USDC queue

## Summary

An attacker can `depositUSDC` several times with the minimum amount to make a DoS(out of gas)

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `depositUSDC` push each deposit to the `deposits` array
Every deposit the length increase and with this the gas consumed to walk through the array
The array could be so large that the gas consumed to walk through the array it would not fit in one block
When the contract it's deploy the [`minUSDCAmount` it's 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L99) and this facilitate the attack since the attacker can use `depositUSDC` with 0 amount
Another possibility it's when a user deposit several time, with the same result

## Impact

This broke:
  - The function `withdrawUSDC`, leaving the user funds locked in the contract
  - The view function `depositsQueued`
  - The function `netAtPrice`, broking the swaps of usdc for crab

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Can use [EnumerableMap.sol of OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.7/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableMap.sol) contracts to manipulate the `deposits` array and remove elements when `withdrawUSDC` reducing the `deposits` array length
