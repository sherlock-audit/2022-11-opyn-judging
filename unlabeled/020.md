## Summary
No Chain ID as per EIP-712 in _CRAB_NETTING_TYPEHASH

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L18-28

Signature replay attacks across multiple chains

## Impact
1. A signature without a domain is not in compliance with EIP-712 standard are nonces are not safe.
2. Signature reuse should the protocol be deployed on more than one chain



## Code Snippet
```
    bytes32 private constant _CRAB_NETTING_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
        "Order(uint256 bidId,address trader,uint256 quantity,uint256 price,bool isBuying,uint256 expiry,uint256 nonce)"
    );
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
include chain id as part of the order struct
