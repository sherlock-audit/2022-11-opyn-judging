# Zero amount deposits could make auction and swap functions unusable

## Summary
Deposits and withdrawals are lists that are processed sequentially. A new entry is added when a user deposits USDC or Crabv2 tokens. A malicious user could create many zero-amount deposits and withdrawals in a row which would cause the functions `netAtPrice()`, `depositAuction()` and `withdrawAuction()` to always fails because the block gas limit has been reached in the loops that process the deposit and withdraw lists. 

## Vulnerability Detail
A large number of zero-amount withdrawals added in a row could cause the loop at L693-L695 to exceed the block gas limit and always fail.

The other instances where this can occur are listed in the code snippet section.

## Impact
The auction and swap functions could become unusable. Users need to withdraw their funds, and a new version of the contracts needs to be deployed.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set `setMinUSDC()` and `setMinCrab()` at contract creation. This ensures that there are no zero-amount deposits. It also saves gas as the code to check for zero-amount deposits and withdrawals can be removed from `netAtPrice()`, `depositAuction()` and `withdrawAuction()` 
Whenever a user withdraws either USDC or Crabv2 then it should be removed from `deposits` or `withdraws`.
