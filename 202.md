# Auctions doesn’t check the minimum limit of the order’s quantity, leads to traders get free sqth tokens

## Summary
Contract `CrabNetting` has no minimum limit of the quantity of orders in function `depositAuction`. If order's quantity is too low, trader will get free sqth without paying any weth because of rounding down.

## Vulnerability Detail
In function `depositAuction`, amount of weth that trader must payed for her/his order is calculated by:
`(_p.orders[i].quantity * _p.clearingPrice) / 1e18` (see [this codes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L511-L520))
When `(_p.orders[i].quantity * _p.clearingPrice)` < 1e18, trader will not pay any weth because of rounding down, but trader will also get the quantity sqth.
This case will happen if `_p.clearingPrice` < 1e18. 

For example, in function `testDepositAuctionPartialFill` of test contract `DepositAuction.t.sol`, `p.clearingPrice` = 1e18 / 17.

## Impact
Because there is no minimum limit of the order's quantity, traders can get free sqth with many low-quantity orders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add minimum limit of order's quantity. 
Example, add a global constant `MIN_QUANTITY`, and add `require(_order.quantity > MIN_QUANTITY` in function `_checkOrder`.
