# Use safetransfer instead of transfer for ERC20 contracts

## Summary

The ERC20.transfer() function (ERC20.transferFrom() also) returns a boolean value indicating success, and this parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard and their transfer/ transferFrom function return void instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures will always revert.

## Impact

Tokens that do not actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that do not correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer (and safeTransferFrom) functions that handle the return value check and non-standard-compliant tokens.
