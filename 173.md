# depositAuction & withdrawAuction functions can be DoS'd.

## Summary
A malicous user is able to front run and DoS the depositAuction & withdrawAuction functions by calling checkOrder. 

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicous user is able to listen to the mempool for depositAuction or withdrawAuction to be called and can then can frontrun by calling checkOrder with one of the orders details. This calls the useNonce function, setting its value to true and will cause the order to revert when it is checked again in depositAuction/withdrawAuction. 

## Impact
If a user first calls checkOrder the functions depositAuction & withdrawAuction will always revert due to failing the require check in _useNonce.
