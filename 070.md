# depositsQueued() does not calculate the sum of usdc amount in queue properly

## Summary

depositsQueued() does not calculate the sum of usdc amount in queue properly. Same as withdrawQueued()

## Vulnerability Detail

In CrabNetting.depositsQueued(), j is instantialized to depositsIndex. Afterwards, deposits[j].amount is continuously added until j reaches the deposit length. 

However, j does not start with 0. When netAtPrice() or depositAuction() is called, depositsIndex is increased accordingly. 

        uint256 i = depositsIndex;
        uint256 amountToSend;
        while (_quantity > 0) {
            Receipt memory deposit = deposits[i];
            if (deposit.amount == 0) {
                i++;
                continue;
            }

After the function iteration, depositsIndex is assigned to whatever i is. 

        depositsIndex = i;

When depositsQueued() is called, j will be equal to whatever depositsndex is, instead of 0. The first few deposits will not be counted. Same for withdrawsQueued().

## Impact

Incorrect calculation of usdc amount in queue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either set j to 0 first, then loop through the depositsIndex, or find a way to make sure that depositsQueued() and withdrawQueued() functions correctly.
