# Function `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction` do not check `isAuctionLive` in the beginning

## Summary
`isAuctionLive` is set to `false` in the end of function `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction`. However, it is not checked if `isAuctionLive` is `true` in the beginning. This can lead to the situation of transaction order dependence that function `withdrawUSDC` and `dequeueCrab` try to avoid. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The critical code of  function `withdrawUSDC`, `dequeueCrab`, `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction` related to this siituation are shown in the following.
```solidity
    function withdrawUSDC(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(!isAuctionLive, "auction is live");
        ...
    }

    function dequeueCrab(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(!isAuctionLive, "auction is live");
        ...
    }

    function depositAuction(DepositAuctionParams calldata _p) external onlyOwner {
        _checkOTCPrice(_p.clearingPrice, false);
        ...
        isAuctionLive = false;
    }

    function withdrawAuction(WithdrawAuctionParams calldata _p) public onlyOwner {
        _checkOTCPrice(_p.clearingPrice, true);
        ...
        isAuctionLive = false;
    }
```
Both `withdrawUSDC` and `depositAuction` are on data race of updating  `deposits`,  and  `dequeueCrab` and `withdrawAuction` are on date race of updating `withdraws`. 

`withdrawUSDC` and `dequeueCrab` check to avoid the situation that the auction is live in the beginning, but `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction` do not check the situation the auction is not live in their beginning.

## Impact

1. This case belongs to SWC-114, and is related to CWE-362. In https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-114, the example says "Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs a Ethereum node so knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a tranferFrom request sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus Eve gets n + m tokens even thought she should have gotten at most max(n,m)."  => In this case, we can assume Alice decides to withdraw USDC and submits a function call to `withdrawUSDC`. However, Another `depositAuction` executes before `withdrawUSDC`, and Alice fails to withdraw her USDC. Then, Alice can only swap back with slippage and fee costed.

2. Another impact: Assume Eve scans the USDC deposit data in block `16050000`, and constructs `DepositAuctionParams calldata _p` for executing function `depositAuction` successful. However, Eve does not check if auction is live. Then, Alice decides to withdraw USDC and submits a function call to `withdrawUSDC` in block `16050010`. Eve calls `depositAuction` with calldata `_p`, and `depositAuction` fails to execute in block `16050011`.  I guess this impact is the case the developers of Crab Netting intend to avoid.

## Recommendation
change from 
```solidity
    function depositAuction(DepositAuctionParams calldata _p) external onlyOwner {
        _checkOTCPrice(_p.clearingPrice, false);
        ...
        isAuctionLive = false;
    }

    function withdrawAuction(WithdrawAuctionParams calldata _p) public onlyOwner {
        _checkOTCPrice(_p.clearingPrice, true);
        ...
        isAuctionLive = false;
    }
```
to
```solidity
    function depositAuction(DepositAuctionParams calldata _p) external onlyOwner {
        require(isAuctionLive, "auction is not live");
        _checkOTCPrice(_p.clearingPrice, false);
        ...
        isAuctionLive = false;
    }

    function withdrawAuction(WithdrawAuctionParams calldata _p) public onlyOwner {
        require(isAuctionLive, "auction is not live");
        _checkOTCPrice(_p.clearingPrice, true);
        ...
