# Unsafe `transferFrom` internal accounting issue

## Summary

If `transferFrom` fails to perform the expected transfer for any reason without reverting, the msg.sender's balance will still be increased. This can allow a sender to receive an inflated internal balance without actually transferring any value. While this edge case is not likely, the same weakness is found multiple times in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail



## Impact

The contract may credit a user's balance even when the token transfer did not succeed.

## Code Snippet

`depositUSDC` uses the unsafe `transferFrom` and immediately after internal accounting balances of msg.sender are increased

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelin's SafeTransfer or a similar approach to validating that the transfer did succeed and the contract's token balance did increase by the expected amount.
