# Gas optimization after removing unnecessary method

## Summary
The following function may be removed
## Vulnerability Detail
Private function `_writeVault()` might be removed. Despite the fact that I would agree that it is a good practice to encapsulate protocol's logic, I think this exact function is a little bit an overkill since it only updates a vault into the mapping
## Impact
On each of the 11 occurrences we are passing a copy of `cachedVault` to `_writeVault()` and there could be a gas optimization simply by using `vaults[_vaultId] = cachedVault;` instead of `_writeVault()`. For example [here](https://github.com/opynfinance/squeeth-monorepo/blob/main/packages/hardhat/contracts/core/Controller.sol#L759)

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove function `_writeVault()` and simply assign the mapping values on every occurrence
