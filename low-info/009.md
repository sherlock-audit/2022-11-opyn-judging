# CrabNetting.setOTCPriceTolerance triggers event with incorrect values

## Summary
CrabNetting.setOTCPriceTolerance triggers event with incorrect values
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L741-L749
```solidity
    function setOTCPriceTolerance(uint256 _otcPriceTolerance) external onlyOwner {
        // Tolerance cannot be more than 20%
        require(_otcPriceTolerance <= MAX_OTC_PRICE_TOLERANCE, "Price tolerance has to be less than 20%");
        uint256 previousOtcTolerance = auctionTwapPeriod;

        otcPriceTolerance = _otcPriceTolerance;

        emit SetOTCPriceTolerance(previousOtcTolerance, _otcPriceTolerance);
    }
```

As you can see in this function `uint256 previousOtcTolerance = auctionTwapPeriod` assigned instead of `uint256 previousOtcTolerance = otcPriceTolerance`. As a result event with wrong data is triggered which can create problems to the systems that track that event.
## Impact
Event with wrong data is fired.
