# Malicious Admin can prevent users from withdrawing USDC or crab.

## Summary

A malicious admin can prevent users from withdrawing their assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

The functions `withdrawUSDC` and `dequeueCrab` are related to users withdrawal and they check if the balance after the withdrawal is greater than certain minimum amount. If the balance after withdrawal is less than that minimum amount , then the transaction is reverted. Owner can set these minimum values and there are no checks in the setter functions ( shown in the code below with comment starting from **[BUG]** ) related to max value of these variables.

If a malicious admin sets these value to very high, lets say `1000000000000000000000000000` , then all the withdrawals would be reverted. 

## Impact

A malicious admin can prevent users from withdrawing their assets.

        require(
            usdBalance[msg.sender] >= minUSDCAmount || usdBalance[msg.sender] == 0,
            "remaining amount smaller than minimum, consider removing full balance"
        );

        //...skip
    }

function dequeueCrab(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(!isAuctionLive, "auction is live");
        crabBalance[msg.sender] = crabBalance[msg.sender] - _amount;
        require(
            crabBalance[msg.sender] >= minCrabAmount || crabBalance[msg.sender] == 0,
            "remaining amount smaller than minimum, consider removing full balance"
        );

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revert transaction if admin sets minimum value greater than certain fixed values in `setMinCrab` and `setMinUSDC` .
