# Cross chain replay attacks are possible due to the lack of chainId in signature

## Summary
EIP712 introduces a standard way of signing signatures with `domainSeparator`, that includes the chainId to prevent signature from being reused. `_checkOrder()` currently does not include the `chainID` in the hashed data.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the case of a ethereum hard fork, or protocol being deployed on another chain, order signatures can be reused due to this lack of `chainID`. There is an implementation of `DOMAIN_SEPERATOR()` function but it is not used. We should include the `chainId` in the hashed data.

## Impact
Signature can be reused on a different fork, or another chain.

## Recommendation
Include `chainId` as part of the hashed data.
