## Summary
There are a few places in the code where gas usage can be optimized. files in scope are CrabStrategyV2.sol, CrabNetting.sol and Controller.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Usage of postincrement operator can be replaced with preincrement operator. In CrabNetting.sol, there are four places where post increment operators are used inside loops. Using preincrement operator can save gas.

## Impact
Gas usage

## Code Snippet

 1.In CrabNetting.sol, postincrement is used in functions depositsQueued, withdrawsQueued and netAtPrice.
