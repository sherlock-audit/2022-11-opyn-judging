# Avoid using state variables in loops and load into memory , fix code inconsistency- Gas Optimization

## Summary
There are a few places in the code where gas usage can be optimized. files in scope are CrabStrategyV2.sol, CrabNetting.sol and Controller.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
 In CrabNetting.sol, statevariables "withdraws" and "deposits" can be loaded inside memory by creating a local variable. I observed there is a inconsistency here as the optimization is followed for other state variables depositsIndex and withdrawsIndex.This will save gas.


## Impact
Gas consumption and code consistency

## Code Snippet

 In CrabNetting.sol, ```while (crab_quantity > 0 && j < withdraws.length)``` and ``` while (_quantity > 0 && i < deposits.length)```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

 Load state variables into memory like how you are doing with depositsIndex and withdrawsIndex.
