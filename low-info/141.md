# Cache loop variable

## Summary
An array element could be initialized at the beginning of the `for loop`
## Vulnerability Detail
If every current element is assigned at the beginning of each iteration, it won't be needed to access the element with each `_p.orders[i]` call. And it would optimize gas cost
## Impact
Low

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize i.e. `Order[] orders = _p.orders[i]` after the start of the `for loop` and replace every `_p.orders[i]` occurrence with `orders`
