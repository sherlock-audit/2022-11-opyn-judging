# Incorrect value assigned to previousOtcTolerance

## Summary
Contract in function `setOTCPriceTolerance` sets the `otcPriceTolerance` to the provided value, then event is emitted with the previous value of `otcPriceTolerance` and the current one. The issue is that the previous value of price tolerance is incorrectly being assigned with the value of auction twap period.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `setOTCPriceTolerance` assigns `auctionTwapPeriod` to variable `previousOtcTolerance` which results in emitting event with incorrect values.
```solidity
    function setOTCPriceTolerance(uint256 _otcPriceTolerance) external onlyOwner {
        // Tolerance cannot be more than 20%
        require(_otcPriceTolerance <= MAX_OTC_PRICE_TOLERANCE, "Price tolerance has to be less than 20%");
        uint256 previousOtcTolerance = auctionTwapPeriod;

        otcPriceTolerance = _otcPriceTolerance;

        emit SetOTCPriceTolerance(previousOtcTolerance, _otcPriceTolerance);
    }
```

## Impact
Off-chain applications that monitor protocol will be confused with interpreting event emitted with incorrect values.
