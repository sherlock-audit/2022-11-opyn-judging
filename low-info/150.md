# Keep the constant convention

## Summary
Constant definition
## Vulnerability Detail
As seen on [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L743), there is a defined constant. It would be better to keep the proper convention and create constant for this [issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L729) as well

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Define constant contract variable `MAX_AUCTION_TWAP_PERIOD` similar to [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L107) constant definition
