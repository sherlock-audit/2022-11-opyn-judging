# Two-step role transfer approach

## Summary
Change setting an operator of a vault to be done via a two-step approach
## Vulnerability Detail
An operator of a vault seems an important role of the whole protocol. It would be way better if this role is set via the two-step role transfer approach where we separate the logic into 2 functions:

1. First we are setting the new address as a `pendingOperator`
2. Then the `pendingOperator` have to accept the role transfer. Meaning that inside the second function, there should be a `require(msg.sender == pendingOperator)` check

## Impact
This can end up with setting a wrong address for a vault operator, either maliciously or by mistake, and then influence the protocol's actions

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A recommendation would be to split the operator update (transfer of ownership of a vault) process into two separate transactions - `setting` and `accepting` functions. And when calling the `accepting` function to check if the `msg.sender` is the same as the previously set address from the `setting` function
