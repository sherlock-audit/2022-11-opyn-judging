# Poor and error prone architecture of CrabNetting::_debtToMint

## Summary
Method _debtToMint() should not exist in CrabNetting.
## Vulnerability Detail
Method _debtToMint() in CrabNetting is copying a calculation done in CrabStrategyV2, hoping the result will be the same.
## Impact
If the calculation is not not 1:1, payouts to auctioneers in depositAuction will not correspond to their deposits.
Even if it is now, it may not be in the future, if the strategy is upgraded and the calculation changes.
It is a code duplicity.

## Recommendation
Remove _debtToMint from CrabNetting and use a method in CrabStrategyV2 as that is the right place to do it.
