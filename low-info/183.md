# Old OTC price tolerance wrongly updated

## Summary

The function `setOTCPriceTolerance()` updates the old OTC price tolerance incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `setOTCPriceTolerance()` correctly updates the new OTC price tolerance, but assigns the old OTC price tolerance to the `auctionTwapPeriod` variable. 

This leads to the emit of a `SetOTCPriceTolerance` event with wrong parameters.

## Impact

While the OTC price tolerance is correctly updated, the previous OTC tolerance and emitted event will be incorrect. Since the previous OTC tolerance is currently not used by the CrabNetting contract, the impact on the contract itself is minimal. However, it could have an impact on other contracts relying on the previous OTC tolerance variable or off-chain monitoring software relying on the data submitted in the events.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Before updating the `otcPriceTolerance`, change the `previousOtcTolerance` to the current `otcPriceTolerance`:
```Solidity
uint256 previousOtcTolerance = otcPriceTolerance;
```
