# Pre-increment instead of post-increment

## Summary
The pre-increment operation uses less opcodes than the post-increment. Thus, it is more gas efficient
## Vulnerability Detail
In `for loops`, `i++/i--` is generally more expensive because it must increment a value and "return" the old value, so it requires holding two numbers in memory. However, `++i /--i` only ever uses one number in memory
## Impact
Low - it would improve the gas cost of the execution

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `i++/i--` to `++i/--i` where possible to improve gas efficiency
