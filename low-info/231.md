# Missing checks on immutable address

## Summary
Parameter addresses in the constructor are the base of the contract workflow, they miss check for 0 address

## Vulnerability Detail
If wrongly assigned a value of address(0) to for example `_swapRouter`, contract won't work as expected

## Impact
`withdrawAuction` and `depositAuction` not working, gas wasted and need of redeploy. Reputational damage as maybe someone can deposit assets in this not working contract
