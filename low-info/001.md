# [M-01] If USDC fee-on-transfer is ever turned on, deposits will have accounting issues

## Summary
If USDC fee-on-transfer is ever turned on, it will cause accounting issues for deposits, for the sender is incorrectly credited with the amount transferred.

## Vulnerability Detail
The USDC is a potential fee-on-transfer ERC20 token, it is simply that the fee is not turned on as of current. Consider the function `depositUSDC()`, which uses the following line for pulling in tokens:

```solidity
IERC20(usdc).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
```

If the fee-on-transfer is ever turned on, then the contract will receive less than `_amount`. However, the subsequent lines incorrectly credits the sender with a deposit of exactly such amount:

```solidity
// update usd balance of user, add their receipt, and receipt index to user deposits index
usdBalance[msg.sender] = usdBalance[msg.sender] + _amount;
deposits.push(Receipt(msg.sender, _amount));
userDepositsIndex[msg.sender].push(deposits.length - 1);

emit USDCQueued(msg.sender, _amount, usdBalance[msg.sender], deposits.length - 1);
```

As a result, the contract now holds less USDC than it had expected.

## Impact
Outgoing transfers will potentially revert due to insufficient balance (e.g. from `withdrawUSDC()` or netting tokens or withdrawing auctions).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not use the function parameter `_amount` as the source of truth for the transfer, but rather check the balance of the contract before and after the transfer, to see how much it received exactly, and credit the user accordingly.
