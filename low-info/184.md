# CrabWithdrawn event emits wrong data

## Summary

Im some cases, the function `netAtPrice()` wrongly emits the `CrabWithdrawn` event.

## Vulnerability Detail

Whenever the `crabQuantity` to withdraw from the withdrawers is smaller than the current receipt in the `withdraws` array, it will decrease the current amount in the current receipt and stop the while loop as all the necessary crab is withdrawn. However, in this case of the loop, the `CrabWithdrawn` event emits the total crab amount in the current receipt instead of the amount of crab which is deducted from the amount in the current receipt:

## Impact

As the receipt in the `withdraws` array is correctly updated with the new amount, it has no direct impact on the security of the contract. However, it could have an impact on off-chain monitoring or accounting solutions relying on the data submitted in the events.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the `crabAmount` parameter of the `CrabWithdrawn` event from `withdraw.amount` to `crabQuantity`:
```Solidity
emit CrabWithdrawn(withdraw.sender, crabQuantity, amountToSend, i);
```
