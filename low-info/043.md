# Unverifiable code

## Summary
Code contains a magic constant and a calculation that is not explained nor easy or even possible to verify.
## Vulnerability Detail
The code below uses some magic constant (10000) in a calculation without any comment, while the method it relates to (feeRate) can't be verified either - the IController interface is not commented and it is not clear what the implementation is. Maybe it is basis points and the calculation is correct? And maybe not.
