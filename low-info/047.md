# Many code duplicities that could be weeded out

## Summary
Crab netting contains many places where code is duplicated only with different values.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is a repeating pattern of 
```pseudocode
while (money remains)
  if (deposit < money)
    payout whole deposit
  else
   payout part of the deposit
```
Majority of the payout block is identical in both cases. The most pronounced case is in the crab distribution in auctions where about 13 lines of code are repeated.
## Impact
Big contract size, code hard to read, possible errors as a typical result of code duplication.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Put the code in a private method and call it 2x with different amount instead of duplicating the code.
