# Incorrect decimals in `_checkCrabPrice`

## Summary

The math in `_checkCrabPrice` has a decimals error. `crabFairPrice` is converted from 1e18 to 1e6 decimals, but the math immediately after assumes crabFairPrice has 1e18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

To understand this vulnerability, first examine similar code on [line 772](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L772) and [line 777](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L777). The purpose of this math is to increase `squeethEthPrice` by the `otcPriceTolerance` percentage to check if `_price` is within the price tolerance limits. In order for this math to work, `squeethEthPrice` must have 1e18 decimals because `otcPriceTolerance` has 1e18 decimals and 1e18 is hardcoded into this line of code. The correct code is shown.
```solidity
        if (_isAuctionBuying) {
            require(
                _price <= (squeethEthPrice * (1e18 + otcPriceTolerance)) / 1e18,
                "Price too high relative to Uniswap twap."
            );
        } else {
            require(
                _price >= (squeethEthPrice * (1e18 - otcPriceTolerance)) / 1e18,
                "Price too low relative to Uniswap twap."
            );
        }
```


The code with the error is in [lines 790-792](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L790). The problem is that `crabFairPrice` is converted from 1e18 decimals to 1e6. There is even a comment clarifying this is the purpose of this line of code. But immediately after this conversion, `crabFairPrice` is multiplied by what should be 105% (or 1.05) to check if the price is too high, but because `crabFairPrice` is 1e6, 1.05 in 1e18 is actually 1.05 * 1e12, or 105000000000000%. This means it is very difficult to provide a `_price` that is too high but very easy to provide a `_price` that is too low, causing a revert on line 792 (the last line below).
```solidity
crabFairPrice = crabFairPrice / 1e12; //converting from units of 18 to 6
require(_price <= (crabFairPrice * (1e18 + otcPriceTolerance)) / 1e18, "Crab Price too high");
require(_price >= (crabFairPrice * (1e18 - otcPriceTolerance)) / 1e18, "Crab Price too low");
```

## Impact

The math is wrong because the order of magnitude is off by 1e12, so `_checkCrabPrice` will revert in cases where it should not if the math is correct. This makes `netAtPrice` unusable.

## Code Snippet

This line converts `crabFairPrice` from 1e18 to 1e6 and should be removed if `_price` is in 1e18
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L790

After `crabFairPrice` is converted to 1e6, the math incorrectly assumes `crabFairPrice` is 1e18

Compare to similar code on [line 772](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L772) and [line 777](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L777)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove [line 790](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L790) depending on the decimals used by `_price` in `_checkCrabPrice`. Add comments to `netAtPrice` to make it clear that `_price` should have 1e18 decimals.
