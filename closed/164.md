# withdrawAuction transfer weth step 3 to mms order users varies, potentially causing reverts or underpaying.

## Summary
In `withdrawAuction` step 3, weth is being transferred back to the mms order users. However, the amount of weth sent back is not based on how much weth is produced, but instead based on the parameters _p.clearingPrice from the mms. This might cause underpaying or reverts if weths are not enough.

## Vulnerability Detail
Step 2 of `withdrawAuction`, we withdraw from crab. This also withdraws eth based on _p.crabToWithdaw. However, instead of sending back proportional weth based on the amount of eth being withdrawn, we use an external _p.clearingPrice to calculate how much to send back to the user `            IERC20(weth).transfer(_p.orders[i].trader, (sqthQuantity * _p.clearingPrice) / 1e18);`
. 
Imagine if you add 1 to _p.clearingPrice. As long as p.order[i].price is less or equal, that will work. By adding 1 to _p.clearingPrice, we are sending every mms order user 1 additional eth, even though the amount of eth withdrawn from step 2 is the same. 
```solidity
        // step 2 withdraw from crab
        ICrabStrategyV2(crab).withdraw(_p.crabToWithdraw);


        // step 3 pay all mms
        IWETH(weth).deposit{value: address(this).balance - initEthBalance}();
        toPull = sqthRequired;
        uint256 sqthQuantity;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _p.orders.length && toPull > 0; i++) {
            if (_p.orders[i].quantity < toPull) {
                sqthQuantity = _p.orders[i].quantity;
            } else {
                sqthQuantity = toPull;
            }
            IERC20(weth).transfer(_p.orders[i].trader, (sqthQuantity * _p.clearingPrice) / 1e18);
            toPull -= sqthQuantity;
            emit BidTraded(_p.orders[i].bidId, _p.orders[i].trader, sqthQuantity, _p.clearingPrice, false);
        }

```

## Impact
MMs order users selling sqth might get lesser weth or `withdrawAuction` might revert.

## Recommendation
Consider sending back weth proportionally 
```solidity
        // step 3 pay all mms
        // calculate weth produced
        uint256 wethClaimed = address(this).balance - initEthBalance;
        IWETH(weth).deposit{value: address(this).balance - initEthBalance}();
        
       //Other code skipped for brevity
       
       IERC20(weth).transfer(_p.orders[i].trader, ( sqthQuantity * 1e18 / sqthRequired ) * wethClaimed / 1e18);
```
