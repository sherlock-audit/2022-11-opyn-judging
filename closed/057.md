# Wrong calculation of decimal points in CrabNetting.netAtPrice()

## Summary

Wrong calculation of decimal points in function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function _checkCrabPrice(), which is called in netAtPrice(), calculates the price of crab in USDC according to crabFairPrice in _checkCrabPrice().

        crabFairPrice = crabFairPrice / 1e12; //converting from units of 18 to 6

According to the notes, the _price parameter refers to the price of crab in USDC and the _quantity refers to the amount of USDC.

    /**
     * @dev swaps _quantity amount of usdc for crab at _price
     * @param _price price of crab in usdc
     * @param _quantity amount of USDC to net
     */

Since _price refers to the price of crab in USDC, _price has 6 decimal points. _quantity should therefore also refer to USDC decimal points instead of crab decimal points since _quantity refers to USDC as well

        uint256 crabQuantity = (_quantity * 1e18) / _price;

## Impact

Wrong calculation of decimal points will lead to misleading amounts of crabQuantity that will affect the whole protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change lines that refer to USDC to 6 decimal points instead of 18, for eg.

        uint256 crabQuantity = (_quantity * 1e6) / _price;

Convert to crab prices afterwards with the appropriate decimal places.
