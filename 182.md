# Contract can be stuck when USDC is paused/recipient blacklisted

## Summary

Whenever the USDC contract is paused or the recipient is blacklisted in the USDC contract, the interactions where USDC is transferred in the `CrabNetting.sol` contract will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

One possible (yet more unlikely) scenario would be whenever the USDC contract is paused. USDC is a pausable contract and will revert upon each transfer or transferFrom if contract is paused ([https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/master/contracts/v1/FiatTokenV1.sol](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/master/contracts/v1/FiatTokenV1.sol)).

`CrabNetting.sol` will not be able to perform it’s core functions `netAtPrice()` and `withdrawAuction()` as they rely on successful calls to the USDC contract. Whenever one of those calls revers, the whole `netAtPrice()` and `withdrawAuction()` reverts as well.

A second, more likely attack scenario would be as follows: 

1. A malicious user deposits crab by using the `queueCrabForWithdrawal()` function. A new receipt in the `withdraw` array will be created with the address of the user (msg.sender) and the according crab amount.

2. The user performs some actions in order a to get blacklisted in the USDC contract. For example, by interacting with Tornado Cash. (source: [https://thedefiant.io/usdc-addresses-banned](https://thedefiant.io/usdc-addresses-banned))

3. When the owner of `CrabNetting.sol` performs a `netAtPrice()` , depending on the quantity, it might net the malicious user’s crab funds and send USDC to the user. However, as the user is blacklisted on the USDC contract, the whole function will revert as USDC also checks whether the recipient of a `transferFrom` function is blacklisted. Therefore, no netting can take place if the recipient is blacklisted.

4. Alternatively, when the owner performs a `withdrawAuction()`, depending on the amount of crab to withdraw, it might have to pay back the malicious user in USDC. Again, as the user is blacklisted on the USDC contract, the whole function will revert and no withdraw auction can take place.

## Impact

As there is no way to exclude a certain user and their deposited funds when performing `netAtPrice()` or `withdrawAuction()`, calling those functions will result in a revert. As these functions are the core of the contract, the risk is considered high.

## Recommendation

Consider implementing the possibility of blacklisting/removing certain users such that their funds are not considered when performing a `netAtPrice()` or `withdrawAuction()`. 

Alternatively, it is possible to implement a try-catch solution where you skip certain funds whenever they cause the USDC transfer to revert.
