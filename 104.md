# Signature malleability not protected against

## Summary
OpenZeppelin has a vulnerability in versions lower than 4.7.3, which can be exploited by an attacker. The project uses a vulnerable version

## Vulnerability Detail
All of the conditions from the advisory are satisfied: the signature comes in a single bytes argument, ECDSA.recover() is used, and the signatures themselves are used for replay protection checks 
[https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h)

If a user calls changeRecipientAddress(), notices a mistake, then calls changeRecipientAddress() again, an attacker can use signature malleability to re-submit the first change request, as long as the old request has not expired yet.
