# Possible reentrancy attacks in netAtPrice

## Summary
Contract function `netAtPrice` does not follow the CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions) pattern, therefore it might be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `netAtPrice` is responsible for processing `deposits` and `withdraws`. However it doesn't correctly follow the CEI pattern and the interactions with tokens are being done before changing storage state such as decreasing the balance of the user. This might lead to reentrancy attacks.

## Impact
If tokens will support hooks such as before/after token transfer an attacker will be able to execute reentrancy attacks and withdraw additional tokens by setting up a malicious contract as sender/receiver.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to follow CEI pattern mentioned before, decrease user balance before performing the transfer, and/or add re-entrance guards.
