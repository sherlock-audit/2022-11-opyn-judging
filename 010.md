# CrabNetting.withdrawAuction uses slippage for uniswap that doesn't depend on provided amount

## Summary
CrabNetting.withdrawAuction uses slippage for uniswap that doesn't depend on provided amount. So the call can be frontrunned and CrabNetting will lose funds on this swap.
## Vulnerability Detail
CrabNetting.withdrawAuction in 4th step is swapping weth for usdc. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L675-L685
```solidity
        ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams memory params = ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams({
            tokenIn: address(weth),
            tokenOut: address(usdc),
            fee: _p.ethUSDFee,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: (IERC20(weth).balanceOf(address(this)) - initWethBalance),
            amountOutMinimum: _p.minUSDC,
            sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
        });
        uint256 usdcReceived = swapRouter.exactInputSingle(params);
```

As you can see the amount provided is `IERC20(weth).balanceOf(address(this)) - initWethBalance` and it's not known on the beginning what the amount will be swapped.
But also for slippage `_p.minUSDC` amount is used that is provided by owner as param.
This `_p.minUSDC` was not calculated using `IERC20(weth).balanceOf(address(this)) - initWethBalance` amount and that's why it's not efficient.

Example.
1.Owner provided `_p.minUSDC` as 100 usdc.
2.`IERC20(weth).balanceOf(address(this)) - initWethBalance` is 200 usdc worth amount.
3.Someone frontrunned CrabNetting.withdrawAuction function and manipulated price of pool, so swapped amount was 100 usdc
4.CrabNetting lost 100 usdc
## Impact
Lost of funds while swapping.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate slippage after you know inputAmount. For example calculate how much you can get with current price in the pool and use 10% as slippage.
