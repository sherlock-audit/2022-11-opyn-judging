# There is a possibility that the initial weth balance is more  then whats in the contract which will make it revert

## Summary
When the owner is calling `withrdrawAuction` function and checks the orders but there can be a scenario that the function reverts and the owner is not able to process withdraws.
## Vulnerability Detail
ex:
`initWethBalance= 1 weth`
the contract withdraws 1 eth and deposits  1 weth 
the owner has an order that a trader gets 1.2 weth
now the `weth.balanceOf(address(this)= 0.8`   
now when we try to use uniswap router 
```solidity 
      amountIn: (IERC20(weth).balanceOf(address(this)) -
                    initWethBalance),
```
it will revert because (0.8-1) and it's an underflow and since 0.8 solidity it will revert.
## Impact
The owner will not be able to withdraw the auction and it can cause dos and the possibility of the traders not being able to withdraw funds this can be done maliciously set up so the owner can't withdraw the auction and it can cause loss of funds.
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
        // step 1 get sqth from mms
        uint256 sqthRequired = ICrabStrategyV2(crab).getWsqueethFromCrabAmount(_p.crabToWithdraw);
        uint256 toPull = sqthRequired;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _p.orders.length && toPull > 0; i++) {
            _checkOrder(_p.orders[i]);
            require(!_p.orders[i].isBuying, "auction order is not selling");
            require(_p.orders[i].price <= _p.clearingPrice, "sell order price greater than clearing");
            if (_p.orders[i].quantity < toPull) {
                toPull -= _p.orders[i].quantity;
                IERC20(sqth).transferFrom(_p.orders[i].trader, address(this), _p.orders[i].quantity);
            } else {
                IERC20(sqth).transferFrom(_p.orders[i].trader, address(this), toPull);
                toPull = 0;
            }
        }

        // step 2 withdraw from crab
        ICrabStrategyV2(crab).withdraw(_p.crabToWithdraw);

        // step 3 pay all mms
        IWETH(weth).deposit{value: address(this).balance - initEthBalance}();
        toPull = sqthRequired;
        uint256 sqthQuantity;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _p.orders.length && toPull > 0; i++) {
            if (_p.orders[i].quantity < toPull) {
                sqthQuantity = _p.orders[i].quantity;
            } else {
                sqthQuantity = toPull;
            }
            IERC20(weth).transfer(_p.orders[i].trader, (sqthQuantity * _p.clearingPrice) / 1e18);
            toPull -= sqthQuantity;
            emit BidTraded(_p.orders[i].bidId, _p.orders[i].trader, sqthQuantity, _p.clearingPrice, false);
        }

        // step 4 convert to USDC
        ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams memory params = ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams({
            tokenIn: address(weth),
            tokenOut: address(usdc),
            fee: _p.ethUSDFee,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: (IERC20(weth).balanceOf(address(this)) - initWethBalance),
            amountOutMinimum: _p.minUSDC,
            sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
        });

Manual Review

## Recommendation
make a ternary operator make if the lesser amount is able to withdraw and don't underflow use that amount.
Also just do some withdraws at a time to make it less possible that a weird scenario can happen.
