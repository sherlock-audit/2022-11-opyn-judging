# A malicious user can cancel other's orders using `CrabNetting.checkOrder()`.

## Summary
Normally orders should be canceled by the order maker.

But any users can cancel any active orders using `CrabNetting.checkOrder()` and the auction wouldn't work properly.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is an `external` function `checkOrder()` to check if the order is valid in `CrabNetting.sol`.

```solidity
    function checkOrder(Order memory _order) external {
        return _checkOrder(_order);
    }
```

And it calls `_useNonce()` inside.

```solidity
    function _useNonce(address _trader, uint256 _nonce) internal {
        require(!nonces[_trader][_nonce], "Nonce already used");
        nonces[_trader][_nonce] = true;
    }
```

But this function checks if the nonce has been used or not so it will revert from the second call.

As a result, the order will be marked as `already used` if a malicious user calls `checkOrder()` with that order first.

## Impact
The auction wouldn't work as expected because active orders for the auction can be canceled by anyone.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think we should remove the `checkOrder()` function or make it a `view` function that doesn't change the `nonces` mapping.
