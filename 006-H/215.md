# `checkOrder()` need access control

## Summary

Anyone can call `checkOrder()` to invalidated an order. If someone other than the trader of the order call to invalidate an order, the normal auction operations could be influenced, traders could also suffer loss due to the cancellation of their orders.


## Vulnerability Detail

In `_useNonce()`, this order can be invalidated by setting the `nonces[][]` to be true, then in the auction call will fail due to revert in `_checkOrder(_p.orders[i])`.

The severity of impacts vary. During severe market conditions  malicious user could even frontrun the admin's auction txn and invalidate the orders. When the market is tumbling, the price is changing rapidly, and the failure of txn could cause fund loss for lots of users.

Or for example, the trader plan to stop loss with the order, but since the order is cancelled, the trader's position could be liquidated.



## Impact

- The `order.trader` could suffer loss by others due to the cancellation of the orders. 
- Normal strategy auction operation could not function as expected due to invalid orders.
