# `_checkOrder()` can be bypassed as it fails to check return value of 0

## Summary
`ECDSA.recover()` returns value of 0 if invalid parameters are given to the function. An order that is false can be considered valid if user passes `order.trader = address(0)`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_checkOrder()` checks for `require(offerSigner == _order.trader, "Signature not correct")` to verify if signature is correct. However, when making an order, user can set `order.trader = 0` to bypass this check.

## Impact
Signature verification does not work as intended and can be bypassed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the check `require(offerSigner != address(0))`.
