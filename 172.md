# fees does not have limit, potentially causing user to pay 100% in fees

## Summary
In _calcFeeAdjustment, there's no check on fees. `feeRate()` can return 10000 and user will pay 100% fees, causing user to receive nothing.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_calcFeeAdjustment`, there is no limit to how much feeRate can go. Therefore, if 10000 is the fee rate, user will receive nothing as all will be given to fees.
```solidity
    function _calcFeeAdjustment() internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 feeRate = IController(sqthController).feeRate();
        if (feeRate == 0) return 0;
        uint256 squeethEthPrice = IOracle(oracle).getTwap(ethSqueethPool, sqth, weth, sqthTwapPeriod, true);
        return (squeethEthPrice * feeRate) / 10000;
    }

```

## Impact
User will receive nothing if feeRate is set to 100%.

## Recommendation

consider putting a limit to fees
`require (feeRate <= MAX_FEE_RATE);`
