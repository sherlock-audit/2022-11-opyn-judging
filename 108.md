# Orders Can Be Frontrun To Render Them Useless

## Summary
When an admin calls the `depositAuction()` or `withdrawAuction()`, part of the `DepositAuctionParams` are the orders which are to be filled. Because they contain signatures from users, they can be seen in the mempool and exploited before they are filled and render them useless.
## Vulnerability Detail
Say an admin calls the `depositAuction()`. Within this order, there is a signature from the users who signed each.

The `checkOrder()` allows a user to input an order to check it's validity but uses the trader's nonce, so a malicious user can watch the mempool and look for every order in the parameters. They will then front-run the admin's `depositAuction()` and call `checkOrder()` for each order exposed in the mempool and it will use up the nonce in each order, which will cause the `depositAuction()` call to revert.

## Impact
Orders are easily exploitable because `checkOrder()` can use up a trader's nonce and render every order useless if a user decides to grief. Marked as High because the investment for the attacker to grief is very small, as it is just gas spent and has detrimental implications.
