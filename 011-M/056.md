# Unbounded loop can consume all the gas and revert transaction.

## Summary

The unbounded gas loop can consume all the gas and revert transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The code has a few loops, while the function that uses onlyOwner let only controls how many order / transaction process, there are still unbounded loops that can consume all the gas and revert transactions.

when the deposutUSDC is called, the array size of deposits grows over time, and has no upper bound limit.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice queue USDC for deposit into crab strategy
     * @param _amount USDC amount to deposit
     */
    function depositUSDC(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(_amount >= minUSDCAmount, "deposit amount smaller than minimum OTC amount");

        IERC20(usdc).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        // update usd balance of user, add their receipt, and receipt index to user deposits index
        usdBalance[msg.sender] = usdBalance[msg.sender] + _amount;
        deposits.push(Receipt(msg.sender, _amount));
        userDepositsIndex[msg.sender].push(deposits.length - 1);

        emit USDCQueued(msg.sender, _amount, usdBalance[msg.sender], deposits.length - 1);
    }
```

When queueCrabForWithdrawal is called, the withdraws array size can grow over time and has no upper limit.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice queue Crab for withdraw from crab strategy
 * @param _amount crab amount to withdraw
 */
function queueCrabForWithdrawal(uint256 _amount) external {
	require(_amount >= minCrabAmount, "withdraw amount smaller than minimum OTC amount");
	IERC20(crab).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
	crabBalance[msg.sender] = crabBalance[msg.sender] + _amount;
	withdraws.push(Receipt(msg.sender, _amount));
	userWithdrawsIndex[msg.sender].push(withdraws.length - 1);
	emit CrabQueued(msg.sender, _amount, crabBalance[msg.sender], withdraws.length - 1);
}
```

then when we need to view the total deposit amount and total withdraw amount, we need to loop the entire array with no upper limit, which can consume all the gas and revert transactions.

```solidity
/**
 * @return sum usdc amount in queue
 */
function depositsQueued() external view returns (uint256) {
	uint256 j = depositsIndex;
	uint256 sum;
	while (j < deposits.length) {
		sum = sum + deposits[j].amount;
		j++;
	}
	return sum;
}

/**
 * @return sum crab amount in queue
 */
function withdrawsQueued() external view returns (uint256) {
	uint256 j = withdrawsIndex;
	uint256 sum;
	while (j < withdraws.length) {
		sum = sum + withdraws[j].amount;
		j++;
	}
	return sum;
}
```

## Impact

The unbounded gas loop can consume all the gas and revert transactions.

## Recommendation

We recommend the project add upper limit for the deposit and withdraw array to avoid the unbounded loop.
