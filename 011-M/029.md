# User Deposits Index not purged

## Summary
On USDC withdraw User Deposits Index is not purged
 
## Vulnerability Detail
This userDepositsIndex[msg.sender] is not deleted (or poped) after withdraw after this block
```solidity
 } else {
  toRemove -= r.amount;
  delete deposits[userDepositsIndex[msg.sender][i - 1]];
}
```

## Impact
As unused index are not deleted, withdraw loop on them forever, with one more index on each deposit, till it fails out of gas, gas cost increasing quadratically (as x**2)

Will cause systemic "out of gas" failures  on USDC withdraw, after a lof of deposit / withdraw, and will cost higher gas before.

## Code Snippet
One withdraw cost more than 200_000 gas  after less than 100 iterations , as this test shows, failling OutOfGas at loop 95 :  
```solidity
    function testDepositAndWithdrawFail_POC() public {
        vm.startPrank(depositor);
        usdc.approve(address(netting), 1e8);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            console.log("loop", i);
            netting.depositUSDC(1e6);
            netting.withdrawUSDC{gas: 200_000}(1e6);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used
Foundry

## Recommendation
`for` loop is in desc order, so this is always the last index to drop, we can use pop()  : 
Add  `add userDepositsIndex[msg.sender].pop();` like this : 
```solidity
 } else {
  toRemove -= r.amount;
  delete deposits[userDepositsIndex[msg.sender][i - 1]];
  userDepositsIndex[msg.sender].pop();
}
```
