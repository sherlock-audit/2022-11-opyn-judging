# Not clearing an array leads to growing gas cost for the user

## Summary
In CrabNetting, each user has the userDepositsIndex[] array. The array is never cleared, which may lead to arbitrarily long looping over zero deposits.
## Vulnerability Detail
withdrawUSDC (and the crab equivalent) loops over the userDepositsIndex from the end, clearing the deposits - and deleting the corresponding records from deposits[]. But the userDepositsIndex fields are not cleared and so every consecutive call of withdraw, if it needs to withdraw more than is present at the end of the deposits, will again have to loop over the empty fields, until it finds more tokens.

Note: while the netAtPrice and auction also do not clear userDepositsIndex  while clearing deposits[], it does so from the beginning of the array, which is not a problem.
## Impact
the gas cost for the user is increasing in time, potentially infinitely.
