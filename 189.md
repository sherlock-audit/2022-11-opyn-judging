# A correct CRAB/USDC price is not guaranteed during auctions

## Summary
A correct CRAB/USDC price is not guaranteed during auctions
## Vulnerability Detail
The main mechanism of the `CrabNetting` contract is swapping USDC and CRAB tokens at a price that's close to the fair one:
- users deposit USDC ([CrabNetting.sol#L261](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L261)) and CRAB ([CrabNetting.sol#L310](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L310)) tokens;
- contract owner calls the `netAtPrice` function and specifies the price at which the USDC and CRAB tokens deposited by users will be swapped ([CrabNetting.sol#L353](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L353));
- the CRAB/USDC price provided by contract owner in `netAtPrice` is checked against a fair one, which is calculated based: TWAP oSQTH/WETH price, TWAP ETH/USDC price, free ETH collateral in the `CrabStrategyV2` contract, and owner-set price deviation boundaries ([CrabNetting.sol#L783-L793](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L783-L793)).

However, during auctions, there's no such strict calculation of a CRAB price and, consequently, the amounts of CRAB tokens that USDC depositors of `CrabNetting` are getting:
- the amount of CRAB tokens to distribute to USDC depositors is calculated using the current CRAB balance of the contract ([CrabNetting.sol#L572](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L572));
- in the previous steps, the contract receives CRAB tokens from `CrabStrategyV2` after depositingWETH ([CrabNetting.sol#L541](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L541)), however there are no checks whether this amount is correctly calculated considering the amount of USDC sold ([_p.depositsQueued](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L533)) and the fair CRAB price.

This also holds true for the `withdrawAuction` function, which mirrors `depositAuction` but swaps CRAB for USDC instead ([CrabNetting.sol#L628](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L628)): the amount of USDC distributed to CRAB depositors is determined by the current ETH/USDC price ([CrabNetting.sol#L675-L685](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L675-L685)) and there's no check whether the CRAB/USDC swap rate is a fair one.
## Impact
Depositors who have their tokens sold off of an auction are at risk of losing funds due to a bad price:
- since there's no fair CRAB price check in the auction functions, they can get CRAB and USDC tokens at a lower price than the fair one (the one used during netting);
- moreover, as long as an auction is live, they cannot withdraw their deposits ([CrabNetting.sol#L279](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L279), [CrabNetting.sol#L324](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L324)), which means they cannot opt out of losing money in some situations.
## Code Snippet
1. During netting, there's a fair CRAB price check ([CrabNetting.sol#L354](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L354), [CrabNetting.sol#L783](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L783)):
  ```solidity
  function _checkCrabPrice(uint256 _price) internal view {
      // Get twap
      uint256 squeethEthPrice = IOracle(oracle).getTwap(ethSqueethPool, sqth, weth, auctionTwapPeriod, true);
      uint256 usdcEthPrice = IOracle(oracle).getTwap(ethUsdcPool, weth, usdc, auctionTwapPeriod, true);
      (,, uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = ICrabStrategyV2(crab).getVaultDetails();
      uint256 crabFairPrice =
          ((collateral - ((debt * squeethEthPrice) / 1e18)) * usdcEthPrice) / ICrabStrategyV2(crab).totalSupply();
      crabFairPrice = crabFairPrice / 1e12; //converting from units of 18 to 6
      require(_price <= (crabFairPrice * (1e18 + otcPriceTolerance)) / 1e18, "Crab Price too high");
      require(_price >= (crabFairPrice * (1e18 - otcPriceTolerance)) / 1e18, "Crab Price too low");
  }
  ```
1. During auctions, CRAB and USDC amounts to be distributed are not calculated by a fair price: [CrabNetting.sol#L572](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L572), [CrabNetting.sol#L685](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L685).

Manual Review
## Recommendation
In the `withdrawAuction` and `depositAuction` functions, consider checking that a USDC/CRAB swap rate is fair.
