# setMinUSDC and setMinCrab can be front-run to bloat deposit and withdraw arrays

## Summary

There can be a situation when `minUSDCAmount == 0` or `minCrabAmount == 0` as the parameters aren't set in the constructor. When this holds griefing vector is viable: an attacker can deposit dust amounts many times, bearing gas costs only.

`deposits` and `withdraws` arrays cycles are used in depositAuction() and withdrawAuction(), so an attacker can achieve increasing gas costs up to the gas block limit, yielding substantially increased cost of running up to permanent freeze of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

`deposits` and `withdraws` arrays are used across the system in an increase only way. Namely in depositAuction() and withdrawAuction() there is a total sum controlled only cycle from current index and onwards. This means that if these arrays are bloated there can be operation disruption.

If there be any delay (non-atomic execution) between constructor and setMinUSDC(), setMinCrab() functions, an attacker can bloat `deposits` and `withdraws` arrays with depositing say `1 wei` many times via depositUSDC() and queueCrabForWithdrawal().

## Impact

Core auction functionality can become either prohibitory costly or unavailable if gas block limit is reached. The latter can materialize as both functions are multi-step and gas intense, executing a number of external calls, while performing open cycle across `deposits` and `withdraws` arrays.

As auction timing can have material impact on the beneficiaries, the inability to perform one will lead to losses for them as the attacker will choose the moment to run this griefing to benefit itself at the expense of the participants.

Setting severity to be medium due to `minUSDCAmount == 0` or `minCrabAmount == 0` prerequisite.

## Code Snippet

setMinUSDC() and setMinCrab() are the only ways to set non-zero `minUSDCAmount` and `minCrabAmount`:

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice set minUSDCAmount
     * @param _amount the number to be set as minUSDC
     */
    function setMinUSDC(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
        minUSDCAmount = _amount;
        emit SetMinUSDC(_amount);
    }

    /**
     * @notice set minCrabAmount
     * @param _amount the number to be set as minCrab
     */
    function setMinCrab(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
        minCrabAmount = _amount;
        emit SetMinCrab(_amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's advised to set both `minUSDCAmount` and `minCrabAmount` initially in the constructor to remove the situation when there is no minimum amount set.

Both setMinUSDC() and setMinCrab() can be kept for operational fine-tuning.
