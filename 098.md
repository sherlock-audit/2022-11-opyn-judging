# ``checkOrder`` will invalidate any order by anyone

## Summary
The system is using Nonces to invalidate orders after an auction is completed. There is no mention in the docs about methods that allow users to invalidate their orders or even worse invalidate orders from others.
Anyone can call the method ``checkOrder`` on any available listed auction (withdraw or deposit) order and after the call the order can not be used any more.

## Vulnerability Detail
``checkOrder`` is calling an internal method ``_checkOrder`` that checks if the signer is indeed equal to the ``order.trader`` but is also invalidating the Nonce. Anyone can call this method because there is no access verification.

As mentioned this method will not only verify that the signature is correct (and that the order is not expired):

in the same time will invalidate the Nonce so the order can be used only once after the call.

The internal method is always used when checking if the order is signed correctly, not expired and the Nonce was never used before inside:

the ``depositAuctions``

...
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L507-L510

and the ``withdrawAuction`` auction method

...

## Impact
I think that the internal method was mistakenly exposed to anyone. The impact here is that anyone now can invalidate/disable any listed auction orders. In doing so in a way anyone can manipulate what orders can get included inside the auctions.

In a worst case scenario a malicious users can disable all auction orders an block the protocol or strategy from rebalancing positions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend to change the order to be just a **view** that only checks if the order is correctly signed and not expired.

Or if the intention was to allow users to invalidate already posted orders to have an access control to check if the method caller (msg.sender) is indeed the rightful order signer.
