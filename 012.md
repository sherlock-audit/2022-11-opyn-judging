# `CrabNetting.depositAuction` and `CrabNetting.withdrawAuction` can be frontrun with `CrabNetting.checkOrder`, making these calls revert with "Nonce already used"

## Summary

`CrabNetting.depositAuction` and `CrabNetting.withdrawAuction` can be frontrun with `CrabNetting.checkOrder`, making these calls revert with "Nonce already used". As a result, Opyn might be unable to conduct the auction and clear excess deposits/withdraws waiting in queue.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Opyn conducts an auction and gets orders from market makers to buy sqth with eth. These orders would be sent to the contract in order to buy/sell sqth to the market makers, and process the deposit/withdraw queue.
2. Eve listens to the mempool and wants to block this auction from happening. She calls [`checkOrder`](https://github.com/opynfinance/squeeth-monorepo/blob/main/packages/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L447-L449) with any of the market maker's orders as a parameter, hence [invalidating its nonce](https://github.com/opynfinance/squeeth-monorepo/blob/main/packages/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L456).
3. When Opyn calls `CrabNetting.depositAuction`/`CrabNetting.withdrawAuction`, it will try to [`_checkOrder`](https://github.com/opynfinance/squeeth-monorepo/blob/main/packages/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L510) but will fail, since the nonce has already been invalidated

## Impact

Opyn might be unable to conduct the auction and clear excess deposits/withdraw waiting in queue.

## Code Snippet

The following test will fail. Simply calling `checkOrder` will make `depositAuction` fail. 
The same applies for `withdrawAction`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the function `CrabNetting.checkOrder`, as it doesn't seem to be used or tested anywhere in the codebase. Alternatively, remove the `_useNonce` invalidation from the non-restricted external function and leave it only on the internal one.
