# `to_send.sqth` is not accurate and not fair


## Summary

In `depositAuction()`, the external swapped WETH amount could be more than needed, results in extra sqth minted. When sending sqth to auction bidders, the last bidder will get the extra amount of sqth, or even left some to the next auction. This mechanism is not fair for other auction bidders.


## Vulnerability Detail

In `depositAuction()`, `sqthToSell` is based on DepositAuctionParams `_p.totalDeposit`. Traders bid with qualified price will get sqth with `_p.clearingPrice` in ETH. Then the contract gather all ETH and USDC, convert all to WETH, to mint sqth. 

However, when swap USDC to WETH in uniswap, the received WETH amount could be a little more than needed. The extra will be combined with the required amount to deposit into `CrabStrategyV2` and mint Squeeth. As a result, the Squeeth actually sent could be more than `sqthToSell`. The actual amount is calculated as

```solidity
    to_send.sqth = IERC20(sqth).balanceOf(address(this));
```

The last auction bidder could become the lucky one to receive the extra portion. Effectively get some sqth for free. For example, ETH price is $1000, Sqth is $100. The exact needed `sqthToSell` is 50, totall 5000 USDC, 5 ETH. But uniswap returned 5.05 ETH, then the contract will have sqth balance of 50.5 after `CrabStrategyV2` deposit. Assuming the last bidder only eligible for partial fill of 0.1 sqth. But in the last iteration to send sqth, all the left sqth will be sent. The last bidder will get 0.6 instead of 0.1 sqth. 

Another possibility is, there is some leftover after sending sqth to all auction bidders. The leftover sqth will be stay in the contract, and mix with the next auction, there will be another lucky one. Assuming the last bidder quantity is 10, but eligible for partial fill of 9.9 sqth. The extra sqth is 0.5. Than in line 557, `if (_p.orders[j].quantity < remainingToSell)`, the last bidder will receive all 10. The extra 0.4 will be left to the next auction.



## Impact

- the sqth auction bidders get will be inaccurate and unfair, the last bidder who bid with the lowest price could get some extra sqth.
- 


## Code Snippet

Uniwap is external and the pool could return more than need WETH.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- modify `_p.orders[i].quantity` if partial fill.
- send exact `sqthToSell` to all the bidders.
- save the extra fund as reserve.
