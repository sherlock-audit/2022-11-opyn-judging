# Two-step role transfer approach

## Summary
Change the setting of a fee recipient to be done via a two-step approach
## Vulnerability Detail
An fee recipient receives the insurance fees. It would be way better if this role is set via the two-step role transfer approach where we separate the logic into 2 functions:

1. First we are setting the new address as a `pendingFeeRecipient`
2. Then the `pendingFeeRecipient` have to accept the role transfer. Meaning that inside the second function, there should be a `require(msg.sender == pendingFeeRecipient)` check

## Impact
This can end up with setting a wrong address for a fee recipient, either maliciously or by mistake, and then [a wrong address to receive those fees](https://github.com/opynfinance/squeeth-monorepo/blob/main/packages/hardhat/contracts/core/Controller.sol#L731)

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A recommendation would be to split the fee recipient update process into two separate transactions - `setting` and `accepting` functions. And when calling the `accepting` function to check if the `msg.sender` is the same as the previously set address from the `setting` function
