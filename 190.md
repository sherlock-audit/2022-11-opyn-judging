# Contract owner can lock user funds indefinitely

## Summary
Contract owner can lock user funds indefinitely
## Vulnerability Detail
Withdrawals of deposited USDC and CRAB tokens are not allowed when an auction is live:
- [CrabNetting.sol#L278-L279](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L278-L279):
  ```solidity
  function withdrawUSDC(uint256 _amount) external {
      require(!isAuctionLive, "auction is live");
  ```
- [CrabNetting.sol#L323-L324](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L323-L324):
  ```solidity
  function dequeueCrab(uint256 _amount) external {
    require(!isAuctionLive, "auction is live");
  ```

The `isAuctionLive` variable is set at a contract owner's whim ([CrabNetting.sol#L225-L228](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L225-L228)):
```solidity
function toggleAuctionLive() external onlyOwner {
    isAuctionLive = !isAuctionLive;
    emit ToggledAuctionLive(isAuctionLive);
}
```

Setting this flag to `true` is not required to start an auction, thus it's only purpose is to disable withdrawals ([CrabNetting.sol#L491](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L491), [CrabNetting.sol#L628](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L628)). Also, setting the flag to `true` doesn't guarantee that an auction will be executed and users will get funds as a result of an auction: the `depositAuction` and `withdrawAuction` functions can only be executed by an owner and an owner might delay or not execute an auction at all.
## Impact
A contract owner can indefinitely disable withdrawal of user funds without providing an alternative way for users to get their funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider allowing depositors to withdraw their funds at any time. Or, in case locking is required to perform off-chain calculations before executing an auction, consider using a short temporary lock.
