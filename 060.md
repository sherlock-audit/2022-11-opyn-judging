# Used orders or revoked token authorizations can cause `withdrawAuction` and `depositAuction` to fail

## Summary
The owner must ensure that all orders are valid before submitting an auction, as a single order failure can revert an entire auction. The current implementation allows a market maker to invalidate their order by front-running an auction transaction, causing the auction to fail.  

## Vulnerability Detail 
A market maker can invalidate their order when `withdrawAuction()` and `depositAuction()` is submitted from the owner by:

- setting the nonce of their order as used by calling `setNonceTrue` or by calling `checkOrder()` and setting the nonce of their or other user orders as used (see https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn-thec00n/issues/1)
- By revoking permissions to transfer tokens for the `CrabNetting` contract or transferring required tokens from the trading account so that the transfer fails.  

## Impact
A malicious market maker could repeatedly cause auctions to fail.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The function `_useNonce()` should not fail when the nonce has been used already and instead return a flag with the status of the nonce update. Orders that already have used nonces should be skipped from processing in `withdrawAuction()` and `depositAuction()`.
The auction functions should check if the market maker has sufficient balance and if the `CrabNetting` contract is authorized to successfully perform the transfer from a related order. Insufficient permissions or funds from related orders should also be skipped.
