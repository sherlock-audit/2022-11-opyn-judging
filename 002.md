# User can bypass depositUSDC() in CrabNetting.sol contract file

## Summary
User can able withdraw(drain) all usdc fund from CrabNetting contract without depositing a single usdc token

## Vulnerability Detail

depositeUSDC() function using transferFrom() for transfering USDC from user to CrabNetting contract file,
But problem is USDC is a ERC20 contract which returns true or false on success or failure respective during transferring of token, where as most of other token revert on failure.

As here function using transferFrom(), on failure this will return false instead of reverting whole function
and depositeUSDC() do not have any return value check condition form transferFrom() on USDC, so further steps in function get executed and user deposit balance get updated

So simply a user can increment his deposit balance without sending any USDC to this CrabNetting contract.


## Impact
By doing this user can increment his USDC balance to infinite number without even sending single token, and when time came he can withdraw all  funds from the contract

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L261-L272

```solidity
    function depositUSDC(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(_amount >= minUSDCAmount, "deposit amount smaller than minimum OTC amount");

        IERC20(usdc).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);  // @audit 

        // update usd balance of user, add their receipt, and receipt index to user deposits index
        usdBalance[msg.sender] = usdBalance[msg.sender] + _amount;
        deposits.push(Receipt(msg.sender, _amount));
        userDepositsIndex[msg.sender].push(deposits.length - 1);

        emit USDCQueued(msg.sender, _amount, usdBalance[msg.sender], deposits.length - 1);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use Openzeppline safeErc20, and replace transfer / transferFrom with safeTransfer / safeTransferFrom functions
