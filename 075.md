# Instead of failing to send deposits and withdrawals, exploits or loss of funds can occur

## Instead of failing to send deposits and withdrawals, exploits or loss of funds can occur

## Summary
the withdrawal and deposit functions will lose funds if you send 50 ETH in the withdrawal and deposit functions there will be lost funds if you send 50 ETH or the like because gas doesn't return the interaction pattern will lose funds or exploit

## Vulnerability Detail
If a contract receives Ether `depositAuction()`, `withdrawAuction()`, (without a function being called), the fallback function is executed. If it does not have a fallback function, the Ether will be rejected (by throwing an exception). During the execution of the fallback function, the contract can only rely on the “gas stipend” (2300 gas) being available to it at that time.

Sending Ether can also fail because the execution of the recipient contract requires more than the allotted amount of gas (explicitly by using require, assert, revert, throw or because the operation is just too expensive) - it “runs out of gas” (OOG). If you use transfer or send with a return value check


## Impact
Summary

## Code Snippet
1. first checks if the user has enough balance to withdraw. If not, it throws an exception.
2. withdraws the amount from the user’s account.
3. deposits the amount to the contract’s account.
4. iterates through the orders and transfers the amount to the trader’s account.
5. emits a BidTraded event.
Function `withdrawAuction()` #L657-L672
```solidity
        ICrabStrategyV2(crab).withdraw(_p.crabToWithdraw);
        IWETH(weth).deposit{value: address(this).balance - initEthBalance}();
        toPull = sqthRequired;
        uint256 sqthQuantity;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _p.orders.length && toPull > 0; i++) {
            if (_p.orders[i].quantity < toPull) {
                sqthQuantity = _p.orders[i].quantity;
            } else {
                sqthQuantity = toPull;
            }
            IERC20(weth).transfer(_p.orders[i].trader, (sqthQuantity * _p.clearingPrice) / 1e18);
            toPull -= sqthQuantity;
            emit BidTraded(_p.orders[i].bidId, _p.orders[i].trader, sqthQuantity, _p.clearingPrice, false);
        }
```

Function `withdrawAuction() & depositAuction()` #L527-L537 && #675-L685

Deposit

1. It calls the `swapRouter.exactInputSingle` function to initiate the swap.
2. It calls the `IWETH(weth).withdraw` function to withdraw the deposited WETH.
3. It calls the `ICrabStrategyV2(crab).deposit` function to deposit the deposited ETH.
4. It first withdraws the entire balance of the contract from the WETH contract.
5. It then deposits the total deposit amount to the Crab contract.
6. It then calculates the amount of ETH to be sent to the Flash contract.
7. If the amount of ETH to be sent to the Flash contract is greater than zero, it then calls the flashDeposit function of the Crab contract.

```solidity
        swapRouter.exactInputSingle(params);
        IWETH(weth).withdraw(IWETH(weth).balanceOf(address(this)));
        ICrabStrategyV2(crab).deposit{value: _p.totalDeposit}();

```

Withdraw
1. The `params` struct is used to pass in the parameters to the `exactInputSingle` function.
2. The `params` struct is initialized with the following values:
    - `tokenIn`: The address of the token being sent in. In this case, the address of WETH.
    - `tokenOut`: The address of the token being sent out. In this case, the address of USDC.
    - `fee`: The fee to be paid to the relayer.
    - `recipient`: The address of the recipient. In this case, the address of the contract.
    - `deadline`: The block number at which this transaction will be executed.
    - `amountIn`: The amount of tokens being sent in. In this case, the amount of WETH being sent in.
    - `amountOutMinimum`: The minimum amount of tokens being sent out. In this case, the minimum amount of USDC being sent out.
    - `sqrtPriceLimitX96`: The square root of the price limit.
3. The `usdcReceived` variable is initialized with the amount of USDC received.
```solidity
   uint256 usdcReceived = swapRouter.exactInputSingle(params); #L537
```
