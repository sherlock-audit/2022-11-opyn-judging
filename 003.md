# User fund may get stucked inside CrabNetting.sol contract file

## Summary
withdrawUSDC() function executed successfully although transfer of USDC to user failed and his withdrawing balance get deducted from state variable.

## Vulnerability Detail
withdrawUSDC() inside CrabNetting contract using transfer() for sending USDC from this contract file to User(caller)
and all state variable changes occur before making transfer of USDC, As USDC contract return false on failure instead of reverting whole function. 
If somehow transfer() inside withdrawUSDC() fails so it return false and withdrawUSDC() don't have any require condition to check that.
Although transferring of user fund(USDC) failed but user balance get updated(decrease by withdrawing amount) successfully, this way user lost his funds

## Impact
User will lost his fund.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L278-L304

```solidity
            function withdrawUSDC(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(!isAuctionLive, "auction is live");

        usdBalance[msg.sender] = usdBalance[msg.sender] - _amount;
        require(
            usdBalance[msg.sender] >= minUSDCAmount || usdBalance[msg.sender] == 0,
            "remaining amount smaller than minimum, consider removing full balance"
        );
        .......
        ........

        IERC20(usdc).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);

        emit USDCDeQueued(msg.sender, _amount, usdBalance[msg.sender]);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use check for return value from transfer()
or,
use openzeppline safeERC20 and replace transfer / transferFrom with safeTransfer / safeTransferFrom functions
