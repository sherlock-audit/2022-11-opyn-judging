# USDC and crab deposit and withdraw repetitive calls can be used to unlimitedly increase the deposit and withdraw arrays

## Summary

`depositUSDC -> withdrawUSDC`, `queueCrabForWithdrawal -> dequeueCrab` sequences can be run many times over with the minimum amount, unlimitedly increasing the `deposits` and `withdraws` arrays and leaving say `1 wei` in each deposit array entry. Attacker's investment is limited to gas costs and one minimal deposit/withdraw.

depositAuction() and withdrawAuction() run the total sum controlled only cycle across the arrays from current index and onwards. This means that if these arrays are too vast there can be operation disruption.

## Vulnerability Detail

USDC and crab deposit and withdraw functions allow for immediate repetitive calls, pushing to `deposits` and `withdraws` arrays each time.

`deposits` and `withdraws` arrays cycles are used in depositAuction() and withdrawAuction(), so an attacker can achieve increasing gas costs of the auction runs up to the gas block limit.

## Impact

Core auction functionality can become either prohibitory costly or unavailable if gas block limit is reached. The latter can materialize as both auction functions are multi-step and gas intense, executing a number of external calls, while performing open cycle across `deposits` and `withdraws` arrays.

As auction timing can have material impact on the beneficiaries, the inability to perform one will lead to losses for them as the attacker will choose the moment to execute to benefit itself at the expense of the participants.

Setting the severity to be high as there are no prerequisites for the attack.

## Code Snippet

depositUSDC() verifies only `_amount >= minUSDCAmount`, so `2 * _amount` can be deposited:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L257-L272

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice queue USDC for deposit into crab strategy
     * @param _amount USDC amount to deposit
     */
    function depositUSDC(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(_amount >= minUSDCAmount, "deposit amount smaller than minimum OTC amount");

        IERC20(usdc).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        // update usd balance of user, add their receipt, and receipt index to user deposits index
        usdBalance[msg.sender] = usdBalance[msg.sender] + _amount;
        deposits.push(Receipt(msg.sender, _amount));
        userDepositsIndex[msg.sender].push(deposits.length - 1);

        emit USDCQueued(msg.sender, _amount, usdBalance[msg.sender], deposits.length - 1);
    }
```

withdrawUSDC() can be run immediately after that, removing the `_amount`, which will be accepted via `usdBalance[msg.sender] >= minUSDCAmount`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L274-L287

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice withdraw USDC from queue
     * @param _amount USDC amount to dequeue
     */
    function withdrawUSDC(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(!isAuctionLive, "auction is live");

        usdBalance[msg.sender] = usdBalance[msg.sender] - _amount;
        require(
            usdBalance[msg.sender] >= minUSDCAmount || usdBalance[msg.sender] == 0,
            "remaining amount smaller than minimum, consider removing full balance"
        );

        // start withdrawing from the users last deposit
```

Bob the attacker can run depositUSDC() with `2 * minUSDCAmount` first time, then withdraw `minUSDCAmount`, then deposit `minUSDCAmount + 1 wei` and withdraw `minUSDCAmount`, then repeat last two calls unlimitedly.

The same situation and attack surface exists in queueCrabForWithdrawal() and dequeueCrab().

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider introducing the delay between deposit and the corresponding withdrawal. I.e. a most recent deposit timestamp can be introduced, and, as an example, `1 day` delay:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L274-L287

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice withdraw USDC from queue
     * @param _amount USDC amount to dequeue
     */
    function withdrawUSDC(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(!isAuctionLive, "auction is live");
+       require(block.timestamp > lastDepositTime[msg.sender] + 1 day, "withdraw too soon");

        usdBalance[msg.sender] = usdBalance[msg.sender] - _amount;
        require(
            usdBalance[msg.sender] >= minUSDCAmount || usdBalance[msg.sender] == 0,
            "remaining amount smaller than minimum, consider removing full balance"
        );

        // start withdrawing from the users last deposit
```

Notice, that `usdBalance[msg.sender] == 0` condition isn't an issue and can be kept.

Similar attack is viable for crab deposits and the same mitigation can be introduced there:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L319-L329

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice withdraw Crab from queue
     * @param _amount Crab amount to dequeue
     */
    function dequeueCrab(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(!isAuctionLive, "auction is live");
+       require(block.timestamp > lastQueueTime[msg.sender] + 1 day, "dequeue too soon");
        crabBalance[msg.sender] = crabBalance[msg.sender] - _amount;
        require(
            crabBalance[msg.sender] >= minCrabAmount || crabBalance[msg.sender] == 0,
            "remaining amount smaller than minimum, consider removing full balance"
        );
```
