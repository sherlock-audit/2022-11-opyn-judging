# No minCrab/USDCAmount allows a user to DoS netAtPrice, depositAuction & withdrawAuction.

## Summary
A malicous user can create a large amount of small deposits/withdrawals to DoS the netAtPrice, depositAuction & withdrawAuction functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
While minCrabAmount & minUSDCAmount are still set to 0 a user is able to create a large amount of withdrawals/deposits by calling depositUSDC/queueCrabForWithdrawal with an amount of 1 and cause the loops in netAtPrice, depositAuction & withdrawAuction to fail due to running out of gas.  

## Impact
The functions netAtPrice, depositAuction & withdrawAuction will always revert due to running out of gas and the contract will become unusable.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialise minCrabAmount & minUSDCAmount to a high enough value to disincentivise a user from creating a large amount of small withdrawals/deposits.
