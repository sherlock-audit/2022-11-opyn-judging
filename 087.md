# Small amount of funds for  a user will be lost,because of  a if check that is made

## Summary
When `portion.eth< 1e12`  the depositor won't get 3/4 of 1 eth which is a lot and not just the dust amount. 
## Vulnerability Detail
When the owner calls `depositAuction()`  and the depositor has a smaller amount of funds and `portion.eth<1e12 ` then it will skip the giving of the funds and equal to 0. The depositor won't get their funds.
## Impact
smaller deposit amounts won't get processed and users will lose their funds.
This `if` statement is not used for transferring crab.
Users can lose up to 3/4 of 1 eth it's a lot of money.

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
       if (portion.eth > 1e12) {
                    IWETH(weth).transfer(deposits[k].sender, portion.eth);
                } else {
                    portion.eth = 0;
                }
```
