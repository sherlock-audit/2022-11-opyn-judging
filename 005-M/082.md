# `withdrawAuction()` will always revert if one `withdrawer` is blacklisted by `USDC`

## Summary
If one `withdrawer` is blacklisted by `USDC`, this creates a DOS on `withdrawAuction()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`withdrawAuction()` sells `Squeeth` and withdraws the `crab` amount in the queue.
The 5th step, sending `USDC` to withdrawers, loops through the `withdraws` array in ascending order to [pay the withdrawers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L704).

The issue is that if `withdraws[j].sender` is blacklisted by `USDC`, the call will revert - see the [USDC implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa2327a938febf5fec13bacfb16ae10ecbc4cbdcf#code) - lines 546-551 for the `notBlacklisted` modifier.


## Impact
As withdrawals need to be performed in order, all subsequent calls to `withdrawAuction()` will revert because of this `withdraws[j].sender`, `j` being `withdrawsIndex`.
The problem is that the blacklisting does not need to happen after the user have been added to `withdraws`:
A "USDC blacklisted" user can deliberately call `queueCrabForWithdrawal` with `amount == minCrabAmount` (as this function does not transfer `USDC`), blocking the entire auction withdrawal.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a `try/catch` block for the `USDC` transfers in `withdrawAuction()`, so that it the user is blacklisted, it is caught and that user is simply ignored.
```solidity
        try IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, usdcAmount) returns (bool result) {
            require(result);
        } catch Error(string memory reason) {
            string memory check = "Blacklistable: account is blacklisted";
            if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(reason)) != keccak256(abi.encodePacked(check))) revert();
        }
```
That would leave `USDC` stuck in the contract, so consider using a recovery function to "rescue" all the `USDC` that was due to these withdrawers.
