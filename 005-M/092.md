# Users in usdc's blocklist will block CrabNetting running.

## Summary
If the user at the top of "withdrawals[]" enters the blacklist of usdc, the contract will not work properly.

## Vulnerability Detail
CrabNetting use "withdrawsIndex" to process "withdrawals []" in sequence.
assume alice is now at the top of withdraws[]: withdraws[withdrawsIndex]=alice
For some reason, alice into the blocklist of usdc.
in blocklist will cause alice to fail to receive usdc,IERC20(usdc).transfer(alice) will revert.
Most of the contracts are processed sequentially according to withdrawsIndex, and there is no way to skip alice, which will lead to the contract sticking.
Therefore, a mechanism to remove invalid withdrawals[] is needed.

```solidity
    function netAtPrice(uint256 _price, uint256 _quantity) external onlyOwner {
..
        i = withdrawsIndex;
        while (crabQuantity > 0) {
...
            } else {
                IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, amountToSend); //***@audit alice in blocklist will revert***/

    function withdrawAuction(WithdrawAuctionParams calldata _p) public onlyOwner {
..
        uint256 j = withdrawsIndex;
...
        IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, usdcAmount); //***@audit alice in blocklist will revert***/
```



usdc contract:
```solidity
    function transfer(address to, uint256 value)
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        notBlacklisted(msg.sender)
        notBlacklisted(to) //*** @audit if in blacklist will revert***//
        returns (bool)
    {
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
        return true;
    }
```
## Impact

 the contract will not work properly.

## Recommendation

```solidity
+    function urgentDequeueCrab(address account) external onlyOwner {
+        uint256 _amount = crabBalance[account];
+        require(_amount>0);
+        uint256 toRemove = _amount;
+        uint256 lastIndexP1 = userWithdrawsIndex[account].length;
+        for (uint256 i = lastIndexP1; i > 0; i--) {
+            Receipt storage r = withdraws[userWithdrawsIndex[account][i - 1]];
+            if (r.amount > toRemove) {
+                r.amount -= toRemove;
+                toRemove = 0;
+                break;
+            } else {
+                toRemove -= r.amount;
+                delete withdraws[userWithdrawsIndex[account][i - 1]];
+            }
+        }
+        IERC20(crab).transfer(account, _amount);
+        emit CrabDeQueued(account, _amount, crabBalance[account]);
 +   }

```
