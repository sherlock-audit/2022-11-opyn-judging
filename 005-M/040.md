# USDC banned addresses can DOS netAtPrice/withdrawAuction function

## Summary
USDC-banned addresses cannot receive USDC, which causes the netAtPrice/withdrawAuction function to fail when sending USDC to such addresses
## Vulnerability Detail
USDC bans blacklisted addresses from receiving USDC
```solidity
    function transfer(address to, uint256 value)
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        notBlacklisted(msg.sender)
        notBlacklisted(to)
        returns (bool)
    {
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
        return true;
    }
...
    modifier notBlacklisted(address _account) {
        require(
            !blacklisted[_account],
            "Blacklistable: account is blacklisted"
        );
        _;
    }
```
If a USDC-banned address calls queueCrabForWithdrawal to add a Receipt to withdraws, the netAtPrice/withdrawAuction function will revert due to the failure of usdc.transfer when sequentially processing the Receipt in the withdraws, causing the netAtPrice/withdrawAuction function to get stuck.

## Impact

The netAtPrice/withdrawAuction function gets stuck

Consider storing the USDC available to the user in a state variable and having the user claim it later
