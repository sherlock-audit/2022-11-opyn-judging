# Malicious user with a USDC blacklisted address can break the protocol's `netAtPrice()` functionality

## Summary
USDC has a blacklist function. This causes every transfer to and from the specified address to be reverted. `netAtPrice()` assumes that every transfer of USDC to user will be successful, but a blacklisted address can break the main functionality of the protocol. 

## Vulnerability Detail
A blacklisted address can call `queueCrabForWithdrawal()` and transfer a small amount of `crab` to the contract. This address will be added to the `withdraw[]` array with `withdraws.push(Receipt(msg.sender, _amount))`. Subsequently, when owner tries to call `netAtPrice()`, it loops through the `withdraw[]` array and attempts to transfer USDC, but it will always revert at this point since user is blacklisted. 

## Impact
Impact is high here as any current or future blacklisted malicious address can DOS the protocol. In fact, there is no way in the current implementation for the protocol to address this issue should this protocol be targeted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a `try catch` when transferring USDC to ignore blacklisted addresses.
