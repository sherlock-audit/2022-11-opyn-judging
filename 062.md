# `withdrawAuction()` does not check if it transferred the expected oSQTH amount

## Summary
The `withdrawAuction()` function does not properly check if enough oSQTH is transferred from market makers. The amount must match on what is returned by the call `ICrabStrategyV2(crab).getWsqueethFromCrabAmount` in line 641. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In line 657

## Impact
This could lead to internal accounting errors. 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check that the `toPull` variable is zero after the loop in line 654. The check exists in `depositAuction()` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L526) but not in `withdrawAuction()`.
