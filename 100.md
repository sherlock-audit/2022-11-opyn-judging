# Incorrect decimals in `_debtToMint`

## Summary

The math in `_debtToMint` has a decimals error. The `wSqueethToMint` calculation will be wrong because `collateral`, which has 1e18 decimals, is added to the product `debt * feeAdjustment`, which has 1e18*1e18=1e36 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue is in `_debtToMint`. When `wSqueethToMint` has a problem when the denominator is calculated. The sum `collateral + (debt * feeAdjustment)` adds `collateral`, which has 1e18, with `debt * feeAdjustment`. `debt` has 1e18 decimals and `feeAdjustment` has 1e18 decimals. The numerator has 1e36 decimals, so this means that `collateral` is the odd one out and should have 1e36 decimals instead of 1e18 decimals.
```solidity
    function _debtToMint(uint256 _amount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 feeAdjustment = _calcFeeAdjustment();
        (,, uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = ICrabStrategyV2(crab).getVaultDetails();
        uint256 wSqueethToMint = (_amount * debt) / (collateral + (debt * feeAdjustment)); // the bug is on this line
        return wSqueethToMint;
    }
```

The reason this function may pass tests written with a mainnet fork is because `feeAdjustment` has a value of zero because `feeRate` is zero in the mainnet contract at 0x64187ae08781B09368e6253F9E94951243A493D5. But the math in `_calcFeeAdjustment` demonstrates the return value, when not zero, is 1e18 because `oracle.getTwap` returns 1e18 values.
```solidity
    function _calcFeeAdjustment() internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 feeRate = IController(sqthController).feeRate();
        if (feeRate == 0) return 0;
        uint256 squeethEthPrice = IOracle(oracle).getTwap(ethSqueethPool, sqth, weth, sqthTwapPeriod, true);
        return (squeethEthPrice * feeRate) / 10000;
    }
```

We can use real values from mainnet to see how this works.
`_amount` = 5e18 (`_amount` is a function argument, so this is an example value)
`debt` = 1066081325175542669814 = 1066.1 * 1e18
`collateral` = 106411953032693264233 = 106.4 * 1e18
`feeAdjustment` = 100 (this is zero on mainnet but we use the max `feeRate` of 100 basis points)
`squeethEthPrice` = 0.05 * 1e18

```solidity
(_amount * debt) / (collateral + (debt * feeAdjustment))
= (5e18 * 1066.1 * 1e18) / (106.4 * 1e18 + (1066.1 * 1e18 * (0.05 * 1e18 * 0.01)))
```

## Impact

The math is wrong because `collateral` is not the same magnitude as the value it is summed with. This issue can remain hidden until the `feeRate` is adjusted above zero.

## Code Snippet

Example calculations are under vulnerability detail header.

The core issue is in `_debtToMint`

`_calcFeeAdjustment` is at fault only because the `feeRate` is zero on mainnet and this hides the issue

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make this fix in the code so the numerator and denominator have the same 1e18*1e18=1e36 decimals. Review the math on this line to verify it matches developer intent for `wSqueethToMint`.
```diff
    function _debtToMint(uint256 _amount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 feeAdjustment = _calcFeeAdjustment();
        (,, uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = ICrabStrategyV2(crab).getVaultDetails();
-        uint256 wSqueethToMint = (_amount * debt) / (collateral + (debt * feeAdjustment));
+        uint256 wSqueethToMint = (_amount * debt) / ((collateral * 1e18) + (debt * feeAdjustment));
        return wSqueethToMint;
    }
