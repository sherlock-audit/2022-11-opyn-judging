# previousOtcTolerance is set to wrong value, emitting wrong values which might affect external parties that are relying on the emit

## Summary
In `setOTCPriceTolerance`,  previousOtcTolerance is emitted to inform external parties of the change in previousOtcTolerance. However, it is set wrongly to auctionTwapPeriod. This will cause an error for external parties that are relying on the emit to inform them on the change in OtcTolerance.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
        uint256 previousOtcTolerance = auctionTwapPeriod;


        otcPriceTolerance = _otcPriceTolerance;


        emit SetOTCPriceTolerance(previousOtcTolerance, _otcPriceTolerance);
    }
```
An example of error can be an external party that has a system relying on the emit to calculate the change in tolerance in order to execute a trade based on how much the tolerance has changed. The emit will return an incorrect value which will be used by the system, causing them to make an erroneous trade.
## Impact
External parties relying on the emit to calculate change in otcPriceTolerance will use an incorrect value which will affect their system depending on their reliance on the emit.

## Recommendation
Set previousOtcTolerance to otcPriceTolerance before overriding it with the new otcPriceTolerance.
`uint256 previousOtcTolerance = otcPriceTolerance;`
