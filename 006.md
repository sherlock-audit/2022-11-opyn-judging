# Orders can be invalidated without being used

## Summary
The `checkOrder()` function performs verification of pre-signed orders. This function allows anyone to set the status of an order as used by storing the nonce contained in the order. Orders and their respective nonce can only be used once.  

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_useNonce()` function is called as called as part of the `checkOrder()` function. It checks that the nonce of a trader has not already been used and if so then sets it to true. Then order verification continues. Orders are then processed when the function is called as part of the `withdrawAuction()` and `depositAuction()` call but not when `checkOrder()` is called. The order can not be used anymore even though it has not been processed. 

## Impact
A malicious user could perform a grieving attack and invalidate any presigned orders by monitoring the mempool and front run any orders that are submitted to `withdrawAuction()` and `depositAuction()` and send them to `checkOrder()`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1.) Change the `checkOrder()` and `_checkOrder()` to a view function 
2.) Remove `_useNonce()` from `_checkOrder()`
3.) Create a `_checkOrderAndUseNonce()` function and call  `_useNonce()` and `_checkOrder()`
4.) Call `_checkOrderAndUseNonce()`  from `withdrawAuction()` and `depositAuction()`
