# Netting and withdraw auction can be frozen permanently

## Summary

An attacker can permanently block the auctions by using a blocked address to fail USDC transfers, which are now required for the auction to proceed.

## Vulnerability Detail

Say Bob knows that one of his addresses is blocked by USDC. He has/can obtain CRAB, which he can transfer to this address.

As withdraw queue requires each transfer call to be successful, this will permanently freezes the functionality, i.e. all future auctions will be blocked.

Knowing that, Bob will block the auctions when it's beneficial to him the most.

## Impact

netAtPrice() and withdrawAuction() will be blocked as long as Bob's withdrawal is queued. There is no way for the owner to manually alter this state.

As auction timing can have material impact on the beneficiaries, the inability to perform netting and withdraw auction will lead to losses for them as Bob will choose the moment to execute the attack to benefit himself at the expense of the participants.

Setting the severity to be high as this is permanent freeze of the core functionality fully controllable by the attacker only.

## Code Snippet

netAtPrice() will be reverting at Bob's withdrawal:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L389-L419

```solidity
        // process withdraws and send usdc
        i = withdrawsIndex;
        while (crabQuantity > 0) {
            Receipt memory withdraw = withdraws[i];
            if (withdraw.amount == 0) {
                i++;
                continue;
            }
            if (withdraw.amount <= crabQuantity) {
                crabQuantity = crabQuantity - withdraw.amount;
                crabBalance[withdraw.sender] -= withdraw.amount;
                amountToSend = (withdraw.amount * _price) / 1e18;
                IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, amountToSend);

                emit CrabWithdrawn(withdraw.sender, withdraw.amount, amountToSend, i);

                delete withdraws[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                withdraws[i].amount = withdraw.amount - crabQuantity;
                crabBalance[withdraw.sender] -= crabQuantity;
                amountToSend = (crabQuantity * _price) / 1e18;
                IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, amountToSend);

                emit CrabWithdrawn(withdraw.sender, withdraw.amount, amountToSend, i);

                crabQuantity = 0;
            }
        }
        withdrawsIndex = i;
    }
```

withdrawAuction() similarly will fail on Bob's entry:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L687-L720

```solidity
        // step 5 pay all withdrawers and mark their withdraws as done
        uint256 remainingWithdraws = _p.crabToWithdraw;
        uint256 j = withdrawsIndex;
        uint256 usdcAmount;
        while (remainingWithdraws > 0) {
            Receipt memory withdraw = withdraws[j];
            if (withdraw.amount == 0) {
                j++;
                continue;
            }
            if (withdraw.amount <= remainingWithdraws) {
                // full usage
                remainingWithdraws -= withdraw.amount;
                crabBalance[withdraw.sender] -= withdraw.amount;

                // send proportional usdc
                usdcAmount = (((withdraw.amount * 1e18) / _p.crabToWithdraw) * usdcReceived) / 1e18;
                IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, usdcAmount);
                emit CrabWithdrawn(withdraw.sender, withdraw.amount, usdcAmount, j);
                delete withdraws[j];
                j++;
            } else {
                withdraws[j].amount -= remainingWithdraws;
                crabBalance[withdraw.sender] -= remainingWithdraws;

                // send proportional usdc
                usdcAmount = (((remainingWithdraws * 1e18) / _p.crabToWithdraw) * usdcReceived) / 1e18;
                IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, usdcAmount);
                emit CrabWithdrawn(withdraw.sender, remainingWithdraws, usdcAmount, j);

                remainingWithdraws = 0;
            }
        }
        withdrawsIndex = j;
```

netAtPrice() and withdrawAuction() unavailability and the whole withdrawal queue freeze will be permanent as `withdrawsIndex` can be changed only in netAtPrice() and withdrawAuction(), i.e. there is no way to skip any entry, including Bob's.

I.e. only Bob can unstuck the system by removing the withdrawal:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L319-L346

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice withdraw Crab from queue
     * @param _amount Crab amount to dequeue
     */
    function dequeueCrab(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(!isAuctionLive, "auction is live");
        crabBalance[msg.sender] = crabBalance[msg.sender] - _amount;
        require(
            crabBalance[msg.sender] >= minCrabAmount || crabBalance[msg.sender] == 0,
            "remaining amount smaller than minimum, consider removing full balance"
        );
        // deQueue crab from the last, last in first out
        uint256 toRemove = _amount;
        uint256 lastIndexP1 = userWithdrawsIndex[msg.sender].length;
        for (uint256 i = lastIndexP1; i > 0; i--) {
            Receipt storage r = withdraws[userWithdrawsIndex[msg.sender][i - 1]];
            if (r.amount > toRemove) {
                r.amount -= toRemove;
                toRemove = 0;
                break;
            } else {
                toRemove -= r.amount;
                delete withdraws[userWithdrawsIndex[msg.sender][i - 1]];
            }
        }
        IERC20(crab).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
        emit CrabDeQueued(msg.sender, _amount, crabBalance[msg.sender]);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider trying to transfer and skipping if there is any malfunction, for example:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn/blob/main/crab-netting/src/CrabNetting.sol#L389-L419

```solidity
        // process withdraws and send usdc
        i = withdrawsIndex;
        while (crabQuantity > 0) {
            Receipt memory withdraw = withdraws[i];
            if (withdraw.amount == 0) {
                i++;
                continue;
            }
            if (withdraw.amount <= crabQuantity) {
                amountToSend = (withdraw.amount * _price) / 1e18;
-               IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, amountToSend);
+               try IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, amountToSend) {
                    crabQuantity = crabQuantity - withdraw.amount;
                    crabBalance[withdraw.sender] -= withdraw.amount;
                    emit CrabWithdrawn(withdraw.sender, withdraw.amount, amountToSend, i);

                    delete withdraws[i];                    
+               } catch {
+               }

                i++;
            } else {
                amountToSend = (crabQuantity * _price) / 1e18;
-               IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, amountToSend);
+               try IERC20(usdc).transfer(withdraw.sender, amountToSend) {
                    withdraws[i].amount = withdraw.amount - crabQuantity;
                    crabBalance[withdraw.sender] -= crabQuantity;
                    emit CrabWithdrawn(withdraw.sender, withdraw.amount, amountToSend, i);

                    crabQuantity = 0;                 
+               } catch {
+                   ++i;
+               }
            }
        }
        withdrawsIndex = i;
    }
```

This can be paired with introduction of the onlyOwner rescue function to handle the transfer manually, say for USDC ban case: auction operator transfers to self, swaps and return the funds to depositor in another form.

Notice that skipping the entry causes no harm for the withdrawer as dequeueCrab() can be run any time for it.
